Upon arrival at the international terminal we proceeded through immigration and security, which again was very busy. After these formalities, we went to the Qantas Sydney international business lounge, it was quite busy but reasonably well appointed for the start of our trip.\nBoarding was good with business class customers following those needing assistance and through the dedicated boarding lane. We were seated in 7E and 7F, centre seats. The seats are a good size with some storage on the right hand side for small items (book, phone, tablet, etc.). A water bottle and some headphones were in the side storage too.

On our previous A380 flight, the bed set up was done for us, so this was another customer service negative. A minor design criticism of the bed position was that the seat behind left the footwell light on and light leaked through the gap in the plastic making it somewhat difficult to get to sleep.\nThe toilet was generally clean but the waste bin full on several occasions.\nThe flight itself was good and was on schedule arriving in to Dallas in 14 hours.\nOverall, the flight was let down by the poor customer service and personal attention you would expect in business class.

Their digital check in system at Sydney airport doesnt even work from the check in all the way to bag drop, ultimately forcing ppl to raise their hands for assistance which leads to a chaotic queuing system being so disorganized and causing a huge pile of people frustrated just waiting to get their machines running.\nTheir customer service are not capable to handle issues effectively as they were not solution-oriented - only looking to solve whats easiest for her, not for the collective of the passengers,\nWe are never flying Qantas or Jet Star ever again!!\n\nFull story:\nWe initally booked our return flight from Jakarta to Queenstown in Qantas flight and we paid a full price (not a promo fare). The return flight consisted of 3 connecting flights, from Queenstown to Sydney, Sydney to Singapore then Singapore to Jakarta.\n\nThey rescheduled our connecting flight from Singapore to Jakarta and it became a 16 hour layover in Singapore (and we were supposed to land at 10 PM SGT). So we booked a hotel room by the Singapore airport hoping to get a good night sleep before catching the flight back home.\n\nHowever, on the day of our departure from Queenstown, just as we got to the airport we were told by the staff that the Qantas flgiht from Queenstown to Sydney has been changed to a Jet Star flight and it got delayed for an hour which caused us to miss our connecting flights.\n\nWhen we landed in Sydney, we ran to our gate but the plane has left. We asked the Qantas staff there asking for clarity and she said \u201cthis is a Jetstar problem, not our problem\u201d?????\n\nIn the end we got to the transit desk and sorted out our next flight (next day). Here we are today 26th of April 2024. We checked in for our flight, the kiosk machine had so many issues on it and there were a lot of lines piling up, we ended up have to get one of the Qantas staff to help.\n\nAfterwards we had to drop our bag thru the machine (again automated but not working as it was supposed to). Mind you, this was not only our machine, it was all the Qantas bag drop machines at the airport that were not working, so again, the line was piling up.\n\nWe asked a Qantas staff what had happened and what should we do, as we\u2019ve been waiting in front of a non working machine for a good 30 minutes. She explained a bit of what happened, and ask us to wait again for god knows how long without giving any other solutions. I told her nicely that it was not nice to wait, then she talked back to me \u201coh its not nice to wait?? Then find somewhere else to drop it!!!!\u201d\n\nWhat a service Qantas!!!!

Everyone went to the airport at their own expense. Bags were checked and people went through security. After multiple hours of waiting, the flight was delayed again as Qantas had sent the wrong plane from Sydney to bring passengers back to Sydney. The rested crew were unable to fly that type of plane. Finally, a message was received by email saying that flight was delayed until 9am the following morning. People left the airport at their own cost. We went to the airport the following morning at our cost again. This time the plane did take off. But not all passengers were told by text/email about the new flight. They were asking passengers to agree to stay in Honolulu for extra days at check-in as the plane was smaller than the one that had flown us in from Vancouver.

I found that the price of flights for people using credit was higher than for people booking and paying with a credit card. I booked several domestic flights in early 2022 which were cancelled and got to no refund/credit. I used to love flying Qantas.

LOL. I saved up a lot and went to the Gold Coast business class. It was magic. I waited 65 years of my life to find out how the other side lives. Large huge seats you could fit 2 people in. Delicious food, perfect service where even the stewards knew you by name when you go on. Faultless and I decided there and then that I only wanted to ever fly this way and that Qantas Business Class was the only way to go no matter what I had to give up to afford it.\n\nWell, it all went downhill this time around. I had to go to the Gold Coast again for my course and I decided to save up and go Business Class again. I looked forward to it all week and was so excited. I went on Friday after work to the Qantas Lounge. It was perfect just like last time. Then that is where it stops.\n\nGot to the plane. Nowhere near the level the last plane was. I might be a little naive as I do not travel much and I thought that all Business class was the same standard. No it it not. Small seats, no separate cabin, bad service and noisy kids. By now, I am thinking \"why did I pay over $1000 for a return domestic one hour flight?\". This is so far removed from Business Class and the experience I had before it is not funny, and I paid more than last time.\n\nSo when I got to the Gold Coast, I called Qantas. The person on the other end gave me an email I could complain to and said that children should never have been in Business class. Ok, I would have to deal with it on Monday and I was resigned to having a bad trip on the way home. I did not realise HOW bad. No wonder Qantas has such a low star rating.\n\nI got to Gold Coast airport and Qantas decides not to open their lounge for customers who have paid for this. They open it up one hour before flight and you can only stay there 20 mins because then you have to board your plane. REALLY, but hang on I paid for this??????? So if you come 2 hours beforehand which is what you are supposed to do, you cannot access what you have paid for.\n\nAnnouncements are given rudely and late. I went to board and then even though I was there before boarding was due to start, they had started early and I did not get priority access and had to wait in the Queue. But I paid for that?????????\n\nThen on the horrible plane, crying baby. When I complained because I am in business class and I have paid extra and I am quiet and not disturbing anyone, I got abused by the Stuart who started to shout. He said that I should keep my voice down because I would upset the people I am complaining about. I said that his voice was louder than mine and that he was the one causing the scene. I merely made a POLITE request. He then said that if I dared answer back to him he would call the police, have me arrested and that anyway he was not giving me any food or drink to teach me a lesson. Apparently if you pay for something, do not get it and other passengers are being disturbing you have no rights to say anything.\n\nTrue to his form he did. Not only that he broke all codes, yelled at the top of his voice explaining his version to the police so that the whole plane could hear and stopped everyone from disembarking for 15 minutes as he was lying to the police. The police dismissed the whole thing by the way and said that there was nothing to investigate and that I did nothing wrong.\n\nThe rude Qantas person on the ground refused to give me the name or number of the person in charge at the airport because they knew they were in the wrong. So I went to speak to the person in charge of International who was horrified and said that he would definitely not let this slide.\n\nThe person at Domestic also told me that the person on the phone did not know what they were talking about and children and babies are allowed in upgraded cabins if parents pay or that they even upgrade them as the cabins are smaller and there are less people to disturb then in coach.\n\nSo if you pay a fortune to fly an upgraded class, you should expect them to put screaming babies and badly behaved children as they don't want to disturb coach but it is ok to disturb you who has paid 3 times more. You should not complain and ask that other passengers behave because that will get you to have to talk to the police and embarrass you walking through the airport which I guess was the aim of this rude person which should be sacked.\n\nYou will also not get Business class but a pretend Business class and you will not get access to a lounge which is what you have paid for. So not quite sure why I paid so much????? Hmmmmm!!!!!!!\n\nI explained to the rude Stewart that I am respectful, I am quiet, I do not disturb anyone, in fact when asked if I wanted the reading light on before take off, I said that I could read with the light in the window as I did not want to disturb the person next to me. That is the level of my respect so expecting the same in return I don't think is too much to ask for. He also said that if others are rude and noisy that is ok, that I should not complain and that I should take a private jet.\n\nNever fly Qantas and definitely don't pay for an upgraded compartment because you will rarely get what you pay a fortune for. If coach is better, has better service and if all screaming kids who can't sit down and be quiet and screaming babies are automatically put into Business because there are less people to disturb there as I was clearly told then what am I paying for?", "travel_date": "March 2024", "legroom": "3", "seat_comfort": "3", "inflight_entertainment": "3", "customer_service": "1", "value_for_money": "1", "cleanliness": "5", "checkin_and_boarding": "4", "food_and_beverage": "3"}, {"rating": "3", "review_title": "middle of the round experience at best", "review_content": "Been a few years since i flew QANTAS business, this flight was an A330.

I've flown emirates, Thai, Japan, Singapore and others and I always get a collection of several dishes along with the main. like fruit, bread, crackers, the main and a dessert. Qantas just plonked one tray which was just the main in front of me, and a lump of bread - with NO BUTTER! what am I meant to do with that? just eat it dry?\n\nthe cutlery was wooden - yes the same you get from a take away on the street. the same useless knife and fork which are unable to cut and stab as is their purpose. I know they're probably going all eco with this, but it's better to have metal cutterely which actually works, and can be reused thousands of times.

I wanted to try Qantas because the regularly feature in the top airlines. After trying them, I\u2019m convinced they are bribing their way into the top airlines listings. The experience was so bad. It felt so budget and grimey.\n\n1. They emailed early on the day of the flight to say the entertainment system was broken and to prepare. This is crazy for a long haul flight and the plane came from Sydney so how could they not have addressed this issue before flying to China. So nothing worked. No movies, no map, no safety video. Also, on board they said people should download on Netflix knowing full well that Chinese people have no access to Netflix. So basically they ignored the problems Chinese people might face.\n\n2. The seats were one of the smallest I\u2019ve ever sat on. It was so tight and the whole cabin felt cluttered and poorly laid out. In addition, the material of the pillow meant everything was sticking to it so it looked really gross and dirty. The toilets were also super gross and the whole experience felt unhygienic.\n\n3. The meal was appealing I can barely put it into words. Usually I take a photo of my plane food as generally I like it. There was just one container of meat or veg or whatever you ordered and a piece of bread. No nice tray or cups or no presentation at all. The breakfast was the same. Really below expectations for a long haul flight.\n\n4. The plane left shanghai over 2 hours late. Nothing was offered for these 2 hours.\n\n5. The cabin crew were nice but quite inattentive. While waiting to go to the restroom, a Chinese lady asked for hot water. There were a lot of cabin crew and not one person helped her even though it was obvious was she needed and she asked. After about five minutes someone helped her. They seem to prioritize white people so if you fall into this category you\u2019re lucky.\n\n6. I complained about my experience as it was so terrible and the flight wasn\u2019t cheap. They offered my $100 travel credit which can be used on a future flight. I\u2019m not from Australia and I have no plans to return in the near future so this isn\u2019t really helpful.\n\nTo conclude, Qantas is a really disappointing airline with a terrible service, dirty and compact cabins, poor food quality and they seem to be on the racist side from what I could see. I would never fly with them again. Fortunately after landing I had a good experience in Australia. It\u2019s a shame that this airline is the first thing a lot of people will encounter when coming to Australia.

That said, if you are considering Qantas for an economy flight, I strongly suggest that you reconsider. If you are flying in business, Qantas is excellent and will take care of you. However, economy passengers are treated like cattle. I have flown around the world, numerous times and with many, many airlines. Over the last few years, Qantas economy has become deplorable. Aside from the incredibly cramped conditions, the aircraft is old, the food disgusting (see pic attached) and as a company they have absolutely no consideration for economy passengers. They offer stock standard responses, but in years, have not made a change for the better. This particular flight was jam packed because of multiple last-minute cancellations. The man sitting next to me had been travelling for over 30 hours from the US, having had multiple flights changed or cancelled. The cabin was hot, and despite the red faces of passengers and sweat pouring from our brows, the crew did nothing, and we were flying into a 40-degree day in Perth. The Qantas lounge in Melbourne was in complete disarray, with escalators broken and staff trying to cope with all the cancelled flights and confused people. Even the cleaning staff could not wait and were vacuuming into distressed people seeking information. Whenever I exit a Qantas flight in economy, my body aches from having to sit in contorted positions to fit into the seats. If you listen, you can hear other passengers complaining or in shock at the lack of space. Trying to get information about my changed flights, I called the Qantas line for frequent flyers and encountered incredibly rude and unhelpful staff. This was once a great airline, and it is a shame to see that their focus is now only on business class. A test for a good comnpany is how they react when things go bad.

On 9th October 2023 I received a message from Qantas that my flight QF436 departing from Melbourne to Sydney at 11am has been cancelled and my new flight QF428 will depart at 9.15am. When I arrived in Melbourne around 7.20am, I had to go through Quarantine queue due to the outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in Bali. I was nervous that I may miss my connecting flight as it happened in November 2022 when my wife and I missed my connecting flight from Melbourne to Sydney due to the late arrival of Qantas flight from Delhi followed by inordinate delay in the arrival of our luggage ( outsourcing of luggage services by Qantas). Not only did we miss our connecting flight, we had to face a very arrogant. Qantas staff member at the conveyer belt who threatened me that her supervisor would deal with me when I check in at the Domestic Terminal ( and it actually happened), and then we were booked on a much later flight and downgraded from the Business class to the Economy class cabin by the Supervisor (vengeance the most probable cause). It took us 11 months to get the refund after many phone calls and filling up forms. We were actually advised to furnish our boarding passes to prove that we actually travelled in Economy class ( wow - that\u2019s a new low by Qantas - their systems are so inefficient I assume).\n\nNow coming back to the latest issue. I was really worried that I may miss my flight just like it happened last November and may be downgraded from business class to economy on the new flight ( I heard that Qantas keep the details of customers like me on their systems) and it may take for ever to get a refund! Luckily, I made it to the flight!!! When my hostess (probably her name was Lynette) came to my seat to take my brekky order, I found out that there was no veg option available and all 3 options had meat or eggs. I raised my concern that Qantas was an international airline of repute and it should also cater to a growing number of vegan/veg travellers and I was not impressed. She then organised a museli bar and yoghurt from the poor Economy class cousin!!! Later I tried to apologise to her just outside the cockpit. She lost her cool and reprimanded me for my attitude. She told me that it was just a 56 minutes flight and I was so concerned about food options! She missed the whole point - it wasn\u2019t about food. It was about customer service - no apology, no vegan/veg food options in so called Business class followed by a threat that she would raise a report against me. I am so worried that Qantas may blacklist me and I may never get an invitation to the secretive Chairman\u2019s/ Chairwoman\u2019s Lounge.\n\nChange of Top Management but no change in staff attitude. If they treat Business class travellers, God bless the Economy class travellers. The End Result:\n\n1. Qantas nosediving from 5th to 17th position for international airlines.\n2.

But once again and fortunately for us, the flying Kangaroo delivered a 7.5 to 8 experience on our short hop over to NZ from Sydney.\nQF3 is a one stop at Auckland on route to NYC and luckily we only had the short 3 hour first leg and not the extended 16 hour marathon.\nThe flight was slightly delayed out of Sydney about 30-40 mins from memory - incoming flight delayed and this aircraft had to be towed over from hanger. Newer 787 dreamliner from Boeing no less.\nBaggage drop off at Kingsford Smith was a do it yourself affair as is pretty common now and quite flawless and with printed boarding pass in hand it was a smooth passage though boarder control and security for a quick bite and beverage before heading up to the gate.\nQantas gate attendants were great and we did get some announcements to keep us informed of progress on the delay and anticipated time for our new carriage to arrive. Staff were observant and without any prompting at boarding allowed our group to board early as one of us has some mobility difficulties. This worked out fantastic as we were seated towards the rear of the plane and greatly assisted minimise extended standing to get aboard. A very big thank you to the attentive staff and a big tick to Qantas and their passenger care.\nThe plane was a newer aircraft and seating etc good, pleasantly surprised to find no entertainment box on the floor under the seats to obstruct leg/foot room as is the case with some 787's. Not the biggest screen, nor the best legroom or width but on par with this product and seating class. There was an issue with the head phone jack connection to the armrest that was faulty and interfered with watching movies etc. Was reported to cabin staff. Was tolerable for 3 hours but would be a real pain in the - you know what - if having to jingle the connector for 16hrs. Plane was pretty full.\nThe entertainment is usual Qantas fair and overall would rate it as pretty good and better than most (excepting Emirates and Qatar). Very happy with product.\nOn board service and cabin crew were great - no complaint or issue - pleasant, friendly and did their jobs well.\nFood - was surprisingly good and tasty - excellent for the short 3 hr hop and 8 out of 10. Have had some very poor offerings from Qantas on other trips but great on this one.\nWe got to NZ a little behind time but luckily for us no biggy\nAs usual Qantas delivered with meeting their primary obligations in my view; Got us up safely, flew us over safely and got us down safely without issue or incident - just what i'd expect and paid for. The delay is fine and happy to sit in an airport or fly next day if there are any safety issues rather than have a drama in the air. The nice food and great service were nice bonuses to have and appreciated.\nTo my experience - generally Qantas have delivered a 7.5 to 8 level of service. Very happy on this occasion and would use and recommend Qantas in future.\nPS.

Air Vanuatu confirmed plane at Brisbane awaiting urgent repairs since THURSDAY 21st. THERE HAD BEEN NO FLIGHTS SINCE THIS TIME TO VANUATU AS THEY ONLY HAVE ONE, YES ONE, PLANE! Unbelievable!!! Asked if we could be rebooked on a later flight and no one had any idea when flights would resume. So requested Qantas assist with flight rebooking/refund for flight and accommodation in Vanuatu and they said not our problem need to speak to Air Vanuatu in the morning. This is now 10:00pm the night before our supposed flight at 10:50 the next morning.\nWe arrive at Air Vanuatu desk at 8:00 am today 24/09/2023 to ask what's going to happen only to be told no flight and unknown when service resumes. Asked as codeshare and all previous correspondence, payments, notifications from Qantas can they get us on an alternate flight answer - no!. Responsibility of Air Vanuatu. Vanessa just not good enough!

You had to walk through the mass of people to get to security and there was only 1 security booth open for all international transit passengers!!\n\nI have never experienced a \u201cquiet terminal\u201d in any airport before!!

They can't control weather - but they can control how they deal with it.\n\nFortunately I was on the 5.10pm flight, others had been waiting since 9am for the 10am flight. They were angry.\n\nWe did not get sms messages. I was told at the counter that they don't do that, as some people don't have Australian mobiles! Well, some (most) do! How about calling those that do? Qantas keeps the numbers on record. They could try.\n\nThey could send them hours later with INACCURATE information twice!\n\nQantas did get me and others, not sure if all, on a flight out of Launceston that night. They provided a bus that evening for the flight out to Melbourne.\n\nThe issues were:\n1. They didn't even try to let people know by sms or calls BEFORE the flight. I want to know before arriving at the airport. I had a friend visit at the airport, by chance, and she took me to L'ton - she could have saved my brother a trip to the D'port airport had I had a simple sms.\n\n2. They seemed to have no idea what was happening. I got an sms at 6.45pm as I was about to board the Launceston flight, telling me the D'port flight had been cancelled and I could not take it.\nI got a second sms in Melbourne as I was waiting for my connecting flight to Perth. The Perth flight was making the boarding call. The sms said the flight from Devonport was not going and I could not be rescheduled, could not take a flight and to contact their office.\nAbout 5 hours earlier I had been told at Devonport counter that I was on a Jetstar flight to Perth instead about 11pm, which I was! I was not long after about to board it!\nThe one side sending out these sms messages - showing they could actually send messages - seemed to have NO idea what was happening.\n\n2. They offered a food voucher for $15 at Launceston airport. Seemed fine to me, till I saw you could not get a basic meal, e.g. salad and drink, for $15. Some people had been waiting all day. One small, basic salad was $15.\n\n3. I had booked and paid for a Qantas flight not a Jetstar flight from Melbourne to Perth. I was then on Jetstar, and arrived about 3 hours later than scheduled flight.\nLuckily a friend could collect me in the middle of the night!\nI should have been given:\na. choice to stay overnight in Melbourne (I am over 60)\nb. taxi voucher for Perth airport - why should my friend, over 70, have to come out to get me at 1.10am?\nc. voucher for food on Jetstar. You pay for drinks and food on Jetstar. I had had 2 pieces of cake at L'ton airport, as that was what voucher bought me, and had expected a meal on the flight to Perth, which I had in effect paid for with my QF ticket booking. Instead I got no drink or food for 4 hours.\nd. same seat booking - instead of the window seat I had booked on QF, I was in a middle seat, next to someone who was clearly sick and coughing all the way, for 4 hours, with no entertainment on Jetstar but to listen to him coughing!\n\n4. Another Sydney flight was held for the connecting flight. Mine to Perth was not. When I got off the L'ton flight, the Perth flight I was booked on was a 1-minute walk away. With foresight, D'port staff could have put my bag at the front of the plane and let me collect it on the tarmac and I could have got my connecting flight easily. These are small planes and it is possible. The Perth flight was not even boarding when I went past the counter, which was right where I landed from L'ton. I had plenty of time to collect my bag and still go back up there - and the counter for luggage was manned but they would not do it. It just required foresight - putting the passenger's needs first.\n\n5. There was an announcement on the plane about accommodation in Melbourne. I had asked in D'port if I could stay over in Melbourne and was told I could not - instead I could arrive at 1.10am in Perth and rely on a 71-year-old friend to collect me at that hour, far later than 10.20pm.\n\nNo foresight, no thought, no care, no respect is how I would sum up Qantas's service.\n\nThis was after sitting on the most cramped seat I have sat on from Hong Kong to Melbourne a month before on a Qantas flight too.

Replacement flight was delayed (because, Qantas), but we were told that they were taking care of it. It was only until we were about to depart that we learnt via email that we would have to stay overnight in Sydney for a flight the next day. We got to Sydney and the email link told us there were no rooms available. So around an hour at Qantas service kiosk they booked us into another hotel. It's worth mentioning that none of the Qantas staff seem to have any idea what was happening or what to do. There was an elderly Japanese couple with us that we were assisting along the way, with my wife interpreting everything for them. We finally got a hotel booking and went to claim our checked in luggage (that was meant to go to Tokyo) and were given a number to a 24 hr shuttle bus that went straight to voicemail. This was around 10.30pm with 1 year old and an ederly Japanese couple who we were assisting along the way (because Qantas certainly couldn't help them), who spoke little english and were just trying to get home. At this point I was genuinely concerned however managed purely by chance of bumping into staff we preciously spoke to who gave us some taxi vouchers. The taxi driver tried to rip us off and demanded an additional $10 cash on top of $80 worth of cab vouchers for a 10min commute to the hotel. At the hotel, a massive cue of exhausted people in similar situation welcomed us. I asked hotel staff to provide water to us and the elderly couple while waiting, before checking in at 11pm. We were booked in on a flight at 6.30am the next morning (to Melbourne!?). The next morning we got up at 3.30am (3 hours sleep) to get shuttle but to drop us at Sydney Airport for flight to Melbourne for a connection to Tokyo. We were dropped off at wrong terminal (I made it clear where we were going and our situation) only to learn check in is closed until 5am so we had to get a taxi to domestic (this was at around 4.30am, wandering around Sydney airport carpark with a 1 year old and luggage). Taxi driver again tried to rip us off, ensuring we paid per person. Taxi van (only one they had that had a baby seat), smelt of urine and the driver swore at every car on road. Arrived at our domestic for flight to Melbourne. Amazingly, and a first for us with Qantas, was that this flight was not delayed, presumably due to an early morning flight with business commuters. We arrive in Melbourne and proceded to international terminal for flight to Tokyo, flight delayed 40mins. Arrive in Tokyo, flight held on tarmac. All with a one year old (who was amazingly well behaved throughtout despite being exhausted). No, I'm not making this up - this actually happened.\n\nAbsolutely disgusted in the way we were treated and I'm embarrassed and sad to see what Qantas has become.

We were then set to go through Honolulu to LAX on American Airlines on the morning of July 28, 2023. We had two Qantas booking numbers and paid for five seats, one adult with each booking number and our 3 minor children listed 2 on a booking with an adult and 1 on the other.\n\nWe arrived a few hours early, checked bags, went through customs, exchanged the last of our AU$ for US$, and ultimately boarded about 30 minutes after the scheduled loading time. Apparently the plane was suffering from a \"technical issue\" prior to boarding, and now the flight was delayed. We were seated, and they kept us sitting on the plane for nearly three hours. That was so long it meant that no flights could now take off, because the 2300 SYD airport curfew went into effect. Qantas knew this, this is their primary airport!\n\nQantas returned us to the gate, had us go back through customs after retrieving our baggage and put 250+/- people out into the cold after midnight (remember, July is winter in Sydney!). They provided cab fare cards and told us all verbally at the gate that they would reimburse $300AU for hotels and $50AU per person for food. Naturally this was done with no taxi cabs outside because the airport was closed, and no local hotels put on notice that a slew of people would be trying to find lodging. It became a total free for all to find a cab that would take 5 people and a hotel with an available room. Somehow we found rooms and a cabbie willing to take us, and it took us until nearly 0200 to get to the airport Holiday Inn and check in. (2.5 hours after we returned to the gate.)\n\nThat day we were initially sent an e-mail from Qantas when we filed a complaint. In this e-mail from Qantas they were again offering to reimburse hotel rooms at $300 AU and meals $50AU per person, which is exactly what we were told at the gate. Now, we had to book two rooms because they would not accept 5 staying in one, and we got the last two available rooms at the Holiday Inn Sydney airport, so these last minute bookings were $294 AU per room out of our pocket for one night.\n\nWe took another cab to the airport early the next day trying to get a seat on a flight to LAX. We had to be bussed to the domestic terminal, wait two hours to fly from Sydney to Brisbane, sit in the Brisbane airport from 1400-2100, and then catch a direct 14+ hour flight flight to LAX. At the Brisbane airport, we spent a total of $190.00 for 5 people for food. This was our grand total for eating at the airport for the 24 hour period after the flight was cancelled.\n\nTwo days later, Qantas sent an e mail offering a max reimbursement of $250.00 AU total. I responded directly to their \"customer care\" e-mail and sent them copies of their initial e-mails offering $300AU, all hotel and food receipts, etc. Instead of responding they, closed both of our claims. I have now e-mailed 4x and called \"customer service\" here 2x, with no response. Qantas refuses to provide a \"customer care\" telephone number, and hides behind e-mails when you have an issue.\n\nI will never again fly Qantas, I do not trust them to stick to their words at all.

Then, upon reaching my destination, I had the misfortune of \u201clost baggage\u201d and thereafter learnt that the staff at Sydney Airport who assisted my 91 year old Mother-in-law and myself, did not produce any evidence for baggage claim once checked-in baggages were scanned and sent through on the conveyor belt. Soon after and the days that followed, I went on to experience staff at Call Centres based in Fiji, who were of no help whatsoever; Qantas Staff at Sydney Airport who refused to give out their names and who were utterly rude to my Sister who was following this case on my behalf whilst I was overseas; to a point of disconnecting her phone calls and refusing to pick up the phone again. All of my emails were automated responded, which became quite frustrating and there was not one phone call from Qantas-Australia (Sydney) that came through to me; to assure me that my baggage would be found instead of passing the buck; and finally after a month, Qantas has offered a meagre $300/- compensation when the contents of my baggage costed way more (although found and delivered after 72 hrs) but had to be discarded due to weather damage. I incurred additional expenses to have International roaming just to be readily available on call, should Qantas reach out to me; but, which never did happen.\n\nTravelling is stressful enough and to have your baggage lost is anxiety at its peak, especially when Qantas - Australia were of absolute no use and it was Staff at Bangalore Airport who were polished in their Services and who were empathetic, compassionate and understanding of my plight and did everything to keep me informed of their follow-up, on a daily basis.\n\nI boarded a direct 12 hr flight from Sydney to Bangalore, checking in 3 baggages, in total.

How then, when their ground staff were the ones to check all 3 baggages, did one disappear off the records?\n\nThe incompetence of Qantas Customer Care has been more like going through heavy turbulence and their reputation is nosediving as the worst performing Airline.\n\nI am yet to have this resolved with Qantas.

Usually, it arrives a few days / a week later but this time it never came. It was 1 of 2 checked bags. 1 made it 1 didn\u2019t. At first the ground staff at the airport (not qantas) were helpful.

Either they could give me compensation for the bag which by law I was entitled to after 3 months or I would take the value in flight credits. Every single time I was told that they couldn\u2019t do anything and that someone would call me back. That never happened. On one occasion I asked the call centre operator if I was wasting my time and if I would ever get a resolution and she said yes I was wasting my time. I actually felt sorry for her. She sounded broken. Fast forward 12 months, many more calls and a complaint lodged with the ombudsman and many more calls, I received the maximum compensation for my bag (half its value) and nothing more.

Our baggage was checked in at the designated Qantas counter for international connections and we were advised that our bags would be checked all the way to our final destination. Well, naturally this didn't happen and we had 5 people with no luggage for 3 days. One of the bags contained critical medications. I lodged a \"missed luggage report\" with the airline we were travelling on but they could not track where our baggage was. The following morning I contacted the local Qantas \"Customer Service\" only to be told that they could not assist in tracking our luggage. I continued to chase both Qantas and our other airline to try to locate our luggage with both denying responsibility. At least the other airline was able to tell me that the bags never made it to the connecting flight. After 3 days of living with out our luggage and me continuing to chase it, our luggage finally arrived with Qantas \"rush tags\" attached. When I returned home I sent an email to Qantas asking for an explanation for why our luggage didn't make the connecting flight, and why Qantas \"Customer Service\" didn't contact me to let me know that the bags wouldn't arrive. From that point on Qantas customer care specialist went into full deny mode and blame shifting to the other airline even though all evidence pointed to Qantas systems failing.

I asked her to move me and she refused. Later, she showed the girl next to me how to recline her seat, which causes the young autistic girl next to me to go into a panic. The woman once again was completely unsympathetic and kept repeating that everyone was entitled to move their seat back.

Overall I would have to say the experience was very average and barely adequate for a 3 hr trans-Tasman flight. I was certainly glad it was a redemption, as I would have been very disappointed if I had paid the $1600 price for this flight.\n\nThe only difference between this flight and Qantas domestic class appeared to be the champagne and more (frequent) drink service. To Qantas' credit, the Jacquart Cuvee champagne was quite nice and the pumpkin salad I had was quite nice. The accompaniments (biscuits and dessert) were very basic and below the standard I am used to on Virgin domestic business service. The beef and chicken dishes offered to other passengers were not to my taste at all and looked to be quite sloppy, below the standard expected for international business.\n\nSome other points of note, firstly the check-in process was very slow. The \"priority\" queue was long and if you can use the automatic machines (for economy) it probably would have been quicker. As we were checking in skis and had a lot of bags (the main reason for travelling in business) we used the manual check-in. The process took over 20 mins. As a result of this and the long \"priority\" security line (not Qantas' fault, I know) we had very little time to spend in the lounge. The lounge time was further reduced by having to take a bus to a remote parking bay, which also meant there was no priority boarding and the flight also left and arrived late.\n\nThe food offerings in the international business lounge were similarly less extensive than what I have experienced in the past in the Air NZ lounge and Virgin domestic lounges, although still acceptable.\n\nI also felt that the business seat was more upright in its normal position than the Virgin 737 business seat, and the recline was more limited (although I couldn't find exact figures, the seat pitch is 1\" more with Virgin).\n\nQantas also forgot to load the business noise-cancelling headphones on this flight and offered a 2000 point credit as a result (which was promptly delivered without further request, to their credit).\n\nAll up, I felt that Virgin domestic business was slightly better, even with the lack of IFE, footrest and USB charging, due to the more comfortable seat (at least to me), better food, and better lounges.\n\nUnfortunately there are no wide-body flights to Queenstown but it is clear the 737 service falls very, very short of normal international business (i.e. wide-body) service. No tablecloth, the meal is presented on a single tray instead of individual plates, not even drip coffee available (instant only), and a very basic seat. Compared to trans-Tasman business I've experienced with Air NZ (old 767 and 777) and Emirates (A380) it felt more like premium economy.

Let me recount in detail the unacceptable experience I suffered on your flight at the hands of this employee.\n\nI boarded this flight, which had been delayed, and sat in my allocated seat. As it happened, the woman seated next to me (I thought it was to be empty, according to the seat booking) had already taken up all the space in the overhead locker above, so the female flight attendant had to help me find some space in another locker, as I was sitting in Row 1 where no floor luggage is allowed. I will come back to this later. I note there is no priority boarding for Business Class at Broome airport, so my embarkation took a much longer time than usual when travelling Business Class (where I note, airline companies make most of their money, even domestically).\n\nThe aircraft departed and soon after (as I was seated in 1A) Mr Crandel came and asked me what meal I would prefer, the beef or chicken. I responded that I was vegetarian. He became indignant and asked me had I specifically requested a vegetarian meal. I said that this option had not been available in the online booking app where I had bought this flight ticket, but that my Qantas profile had this detail (you can check). He said, in a condescending tone, that he would see what he could do, and said that there might be an omelette available in the Economy cabin. I responded politely that that would be fine, as I am not vegan. He then asked me would I like to have a drink in the meantime, and I responded in the affirmative. He brought me a small bottle of the Grant Burge.\n\nI then waited over 35 minutes while he fed & wined the other 11 passengers in the Business Class cabin. He did not speak to me at all during this time. He went back to the galley and was pulling drawers in and out, so I got out of my seat and approached him, and again politely asked if he\u2019d had any luck in acquiring a meal for me. He appeared to be annoyed, and said he\u2019s been very busy and that he hadn\u2019t had time to chase up my particular needs. I asked him for his name and he refused to provide it and he appeared to have no name tag. I told him he\u2019d only provided alcohol for me, at which point he grabbed the half empty bottle of Grant Burgeons from my tray. I then said that I\u2019d paid over $2000 for this flight, and that angry mood further escalated and he shouted at me that I was bullying him and he would call the Federal Police and have me escorted off the plane and charged. when I asked (facetiously) what I would be charged with? He said bullying him. I repeated, that in fact he was bullying me and at fault with depriving me of a meal and only plying me with alcohol and that he would be reprimanded for wasting the time of the Federal Police. He then became extremely aggressive and ordered me back to my seat. I then said I wanted to speak to the Captain to First Officer, at which point he shouted, \u201cThey won\u2019t see you!\u201d and again threatened me with calling the Federal Police.\n\nAt this point in the commotion, another flight attendant appeared, \u201cLibby\u201d - I think the senior flight attendant from the Economy Cabin. She told me his name, after I asked her repeatedly, and she asked him to provide me with a chicken meal so I could pick off the chicken and eat the vegetables, and the cheese etc., which he begrudgingly did. Libby brought me a glass of Chardonnay and tried her best to calm the situation, but said she did not want to get involved or give me her surname.\n\nComing in to land, after the seat belt sign came on, Mr Crandel did not take my bags on the floor at my feet, which I thought was mandatory in Row 1 when landing?

My friend called Qantas if we could cancel that flight and book under the deal. They said we will give you a credit for your flight and you can book the deal with the credit but we had to do it online. We attempted to do so and it said we would have to call to apply for the credit. The next person we spoke to said no you can't use the credit for this. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls of multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. My return flight became a separate booking as I was returning to Adelaide a day sooner so I had to call separately. At one point I had agreed to pay a gap of $40 to change the flights and asked to confirm that I would not be charged a full new fair they said yes only $40 and then hung up on me and proceeded to take $350 out of my bank account with no permission and eventually refunded to me.

I called to see if there were any issues. It was at this point while I was in another state that they proceeded to tell me that I had to pay another $309 to get home. I said that is not accurate but they refused to help so I went to the airport the following day to hopefully speak to someone in person. The lady at the desk called Elisabeth provided me with another terrible experience saying she could do nothing and I would have to call the reservations line again to sort it out. I said the flight leaves in an hour and it takes 40 minutes of being on hold before I can get through so she after making a big fuss called them herself. The whole time she mocked me and to who she was on the phone with directly in front of me. When I showed them the deal I booked and gave them the booking code that I had been provided they refused and said it wasn't valid. They said just because it said 'confirmed' in my app meant that I had a booking but I had to now pay for a ticket. I said if you listen to the recordings of the conversation you can hear them say they would honour the deal and it was all sorted, they then said no this will have been deleted now and the notes say something different. I said I had no additional funds to pay for a ticket to get home because their company told me the deal would be honoured. They refused and boarding was closing in 5 minutes so I was forced to borrow money from a family member to pay for the ticket. They said it wasn\u2019t their problem and it was up to me, even though they had let me fly into another state without telling me I still had money outstanding on my return flight. I asked for her full name which she refused and said to call her just 'Lizzy'. I asked for the name of the person on the phone and she said 'no I can't remember' even though she used it multiple times in the call and seemed to know them very well.

We have been hung up on 3 times. 1 person said they would call us back and nothing and all for the pleasure of $12,000 in flights and $1200 in fees for a Qantas Titanium card. #flyemirates", "travel_date": "November 2022", "legroom": -1, "seat_comfort": -1, "inflight_entertainment": -1, "customer_service": -1, "value_for_money": -1, "cleanliness": -1, "checkin_and_boarding": -1, "food_and_beverage": -1}, {"rating": "1", "review_title": "Mishandled and lost baggage", "review_content": "Horrible experience with QANTAS.!

In total I've spent over 30 hours on the phone waiting for someone to pick up. There's no customer care email address. I have written multiple complaints (and requests for refunds) via the complaints and refunds pages, but no one responds. It's a disaster. And to think they have received bailouts from the Australian government using (in part) MY taxes makes me furious. They have even been boasting about turning record profits!!! Yet they can't find the time (or pay sufficient staff) to attend to the valid concerns of their customers. All they care about is money. But this is nothing new with Qantas. When their competition (Ansett) went under just over 30 years ago they instantly tripled all their prices. And they maintain the same attitude today (because they know people don't have a choice but to fly with them or their subsidiary, especially with Virgin going under). The only difference between now and then is that the quality of their service has free-fallen. I went business class and ate half-cooked rice with some unidentifiable meat. We were offered only cheap wine and beer, with no pre-flight drink. Just like economy but the food was worse. My seat and tray were filthy, obviously hadn't been cleaned in a long time, and staff super rude, lazy and not at all attentive (took almost 2 hours to get their attention. They were all huddled in the galley, gossiping. In the end, I had to sit on the dirty seat for two hours, until the seatbelt sign was off, before I was able to walk up to the galley -- they completely ignored the call bell -- and request some wipes to clean it myself). All of this is 100% truth, no exaggerations. Maybe I was just incredibly unlucky, but it's hard to believe that considering the service was consistently bad the whole way through, from beginning to end. If travelling to Australia, go with an Asian airline. They always treat customers with respect; not like annoying nuisances (and I should add, at this point, that I was never unduly demanding and I always spoke to the staff politely and with maximum understanding). Worst of all, Qantas didn't provide accommodation as promised by the staff when they changed the connecting flight to the following day at the last minute, leaving me wandering through dark and isolated car parks after midnight trying to find airport accommodation. The flight attendant probably just told me that to fob me off; she told me to go to the service desk but she must have known it was closed outside of business hours (no one at the hotels was answering and most of the hotels were fully booked.

I have booked the direct flight through Qantas from Brisbane to Bangalore which has Malaysian Airlines connection between Singapore and Bangalore ..\n\nIt's all started here .... Our jouney from Sydney - Singapore has delayed by an hour and half.... Reached Singapore at 7.30pm on 1st of December 2022. Our connection flight from Singapore to Malaysia was at 7.30pm and the ground staff has advised it's been cancelled ... Around 10 families were gathered and ground staff were trying to solve the issue (Please note when I checked the email later I observed Malaysian airlines which is the cancelled connection as per quantas sent me an email about their delayed start at 8.30pm but I have not received any email regarding their cancellation of flight\ud83d\ude44.. So I doubt it's cancelled.)\n\n[07/12/2022, 11:27 am] Rijesh KV: Ground staff spoke to us arranged flight for us .. Wrote in a paper next day's flight details.. I have asked them for tickets and booking .. They said its all booked and Sent us to hotel.. This was our first experience and we believed them.. and there was other people as well..\n[07/12/2022, 11:34 am] Rijesh KV: The first day first half was great.. The accommodation was good, food was good.. We left after lunch to airport for the 22:55 flight. First thing we did was to call the customer care and confirming the flight details are right... After calling about an hour they have been connected and advised us the flights are good to go tonight.. I asked them about the tickets and there is no update in the Qantas app... They did not have any answer... Luckily I saw the Qatar airways counter check in and checked with them our flights at 22:55 (Please note our connection they have arranged at 22:55 was from Singapore to Doha and Doha to trivandum India through Qatar airways)... That's where I got the first shock... The flight already departed at 10:55 and the ground staff did an error informing it as 22:55.. I could not believe how the customer confirmed our flight an hour ago when I checked them...\n[07/12/2022, 11:41 am] Rijesh KV: Hereafter I have got a clear picture of how bad the customer service and Qantas system for customer support... The major cause of this issue is they don't have a system in place when flights cancelled .. As a customer I did not get a ticket or even the app was not updated , so that I could not check for their mistakes... (Another weird thing happened is someone else in my hotel who became a good friend of mine later had a Singapore Bangkok flight booked.. That popped up in my app, theirs got automatically cancelled ... Later I understood actually ours should be cancelled , not theirs... Pathetic system.. Those guys even got our luggage when they requested luggage , luckily they knew us and let us knew)\n\nThe situation became bad and I was worried as the young kids of 4 & 9 are with me .. The customer care did not worry about the accommodation .. I kept on calling the customer service .. An hour to connect and tell the whole story.. After couple of hours they booked a flight (they said) and advised us they will send tickets.. I don't have to call them.. I lost my belief on them , called once more and confirmed booking ... They said they will send an email confirmation after tickets issued.. Asked about my accommodation, they advised they will pay 200 dollars for overnight stay... Singapore is a costly city, a 200 dollar accommodation will never be good also its a last time booking ... Anyway we did not have any choice... went there .. had our half sleep.. Early morning 4am checked for emails .. No tickets.. Called the customer care again... One hour of call to repeat the story.. It took another couple of hours to get the tickets sent to us...\n\nFinally we went to airport after two nights staying in Singapore.. We were all exhausted.. Got srinlankan Airlines to Colombo then from there to Bangalore (India)... The root cause of the problem is their manual handling of these issues, not proper updating of the system... Hope no one will have these issues in future... After all these issues, our return flight from Bangalore has got auto cancelled and had to book again..", "travel_date": "December 2022", "legroom": -1, "seat_comfort": -1, "inflight_entertainment": -1, "customer_service": -1, "value_for_money": -1, "cleanliness": -1, "checkin_and_boarding": -1, "food_and_beverage": -1}, {"rating": "2", "review_title": "beware 24 hour cancellation promise if using Qantas pass you will lose the value", "review_content": "Qantas make a big splash on their booking page regarding a 24 hour cancellation promise.

I informed the steward that I bought a window seat with extra leg room (due to the fact that I had anticipated that I will be in a straight leg knee brace and possibly in pain). He told me that there is not much he can do to change my seat.\n\nTo my further horror, after I was seated, a man arrived for seat 3A (window seat). So, I had to get up off my seat to let him through. This ordeal happened three more times during the flight as he went to the bathroom. Each of these movements increased by pain and by the end of the flight, I was very nauseated from the pain. I finally threw up outside the Canberra airport.\n\nSince then, I have lodged numerous online claims with Qantas to have the extra leg room seat fare refunded. I have also rang them up to follow up on my online lodgements. These calls were constantly (and conveniently) dropped and when the staff have promised to ring me back, they never did.\n\nSo today (06 Jan 2023), I rang up again and Qantas has conveniently lost all my details (as such a long time has lapsed since the flight). This delay is caused by Qantas itself, as I have continually followed up on it.\n\nTo sum up, I paid for an extra leg room seat, didn't get it and was not refunded for it.

Recently our loyalty has been tested with a couple of poor travel experiences with Qantas in late 2022, culminating with this latest trip. This includes a very poor experience with Qantas Travel Money.\n\nOur recent travel experience occurred on 19.12.22 when we went to check in at Melbourne Airport as a family of 4 for our trip to Fiji via Sydney. On this occasion the staff member checking our in luggage omitted to place a baggage label on 1 of our suitcases and sent the suitcase down to the baggage handlers without any baggage label. We we travelling via Sydney and needed our luggage transferred to Fiji Airlines and therefore baggage labels were important.\n\nThis event occurred whilst I was dealing with the administrative matters for the family, being 4 passports, vaccination certificates, travel Insurance, and so forth, whilst the suitcases were being weighed and then sent down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. My husband politely pointed out to the staff member that they had just sent 1 of our suitcases down to the baggage handlers without any Qantas baggage label. Our daughters aged 20 and 18 had also noticed that the suitcase had disappeared down the 'chute' with no label.\n\nThere was then dispute when the staff member denied that the suitcase had been sent without any baggage label.\n\nWe hope that as a family that we were very polite to this staff member, however my husband and daughters were vey clear about the situation. Eventually the staff member acknowledged that they had sent 1 of our daughter's suitcase down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. This suitcase had all of our daughter's clothes in it for her holiday and also our family's gifts to be exchanged on Christmas Day.\n\nIf any readers of this review have watched the 2022 media reports in relation to how baggage handles with Qantas have treated baggage at Melbourne Airpor recently, and also Charlie Pickering's parody of baggage handlers on \"The Yearly\" on Channel 2's IVEW, you will understand that we did not expect to see this suitcase again prior to the conclusion of our holiday.\n\nOur travel to and from Fiji, via Sydney on Qantas was very pleasant. My husband and I travelled business and our daughters travelled economy. It was our first trip as a family holiday since March 2020, when the pandemic commenced.\n\nHowever during whole flight from Melbourne to Nadi I worried that our daughter's suitcase would not appear in Nandi, and would be left at Melbourne Airport for weeks. This would have had a detrimental impact on our daughter's enjoyment of our her long awaited holiday.\n\nThe luggage did turn up in Nandi. However for our bookings in 2023 and 2024 we are now looking at other airlines. It is our cumulative experience with Qantas in the latter part of 2022, that sadly Qantas is not offering the service that we once so enjoyed from Qantas.\n\nMrs K", "travel_date": "December 2022", "legroom": "4", "seat_comfort": "4", "inflight_entertainment": "2", "customer_service": "2", "value_for_money": "3", "cleanliness": "4", "checkin_and_boarding": "1", "food_and_beverage": "3"}, {"rating": "1", "review_title": "Qantas supervisor in Queenstown is absolutely rude!", "review_content": "Qantas supervisor in Queenstown Airport is the worst customer service representative I have seen.

The staff smiled, and the call bell worked, which were the only two things better than Aerosvit. No drinks were served upon boarding. Couldn't get a flight attendant's attention until an hour and a half into the flight (my seat and tray were filthy and I wanted some wipes so I could clean them). I used the call bell, and the light was on, but they were too busy chatting and simply ignored it. Meat stew -- at least, I think it was supposed to be meat -- was cold and unidentifiable with only partially cooked rice (not joking, I couldn't eat it and nor could the person across from me) and looked worse than anything I've ever been served with them on economy pre-pandemic. The economy food pre-pandemic was ten times better than this muck. I can't imagine that the economy passengers got anything worse, it's just not possible. Really small portion too, with just a tiny bit of fruit and a cracker with cheese. I was really hungry the whole flight. Only wine, beer or water options available. Was told accommodation was arranged for me due to the flight suddenly being split across two days (the flight had already been changed 6 times prior to that, with the return portion leaving from a different city and with the first leg leaving after the second) and surprise, surprise it wasn't. She told me to go to the Qantas desk after I arrived but it was closed. I think the flight attendant already knew that, but was just trying to fob me off because she didn't want to have to deal with organising anything. Wasn't allowed to stay in airport as it closed so had to traipse around in the dark at close to midnight trying to find something. Felt totally unsafe. Cheapest option I could find at such late notice was AU$225(!) because everything else was fully booked. The list goes on. Even the business lounge was serving old fruit salad (the fruit was brown and I didn't trust it) and cold, stale pizza that looked like it had been sitting there a loooong time.

That might not seem a lot to some people, but I have been flying with Qantas since 1980s \u2013 domestic and international \u2013 both a Frequent Flyer and Qantas Club member \u2013 for a massive number of flights (over 1000). Last time we flew Qantas overseas (2018) it was a bit of an issue \u2013 and the problems we had were never answered. Since then we flew Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. Due to Covid, I had a heap of Qantas points saved up from credit card purchases since 2018 so I used them all up for our first overseas flights. I sincerely regret that and will never make that mistake again. The problem is customer service \u2013 not the pilots, planes or schedules. I had an airport logistics issue that needed addressing (yes it is serious) and the local airport has been very helpful, but to get it completely sorted I had to talk to Qantas. All weekend I tried \u2013 web and phone \u2013 no one was able to help \u2013 because it was the weekend was main excuse. IMO their whole customer service 'front end interface' is about getting callers to use the website (and piss off). I tried again this morning (Monday) and after waiting nearly 15 minutes on the QC/FF number, I was given a recorded message from a non-english speaking person (probably overseas call centre) \u2013 \"we are upgrading our system, please call back after few hours\" \u2013 they then terminated my call. So I rang the specific 'Qantas Customer Care' number and after being on hold for 21 minutes I explained my problem. I was told that I had to call 'Qantas Agency Direct'. I tried the number they gave me and it didn't work, so I found the number online, and they will only speak to registered IATA members (Booking Agents). So I rang back the Qantas Customer Care number again and after being on hold for 27 minutes I advised the problem, and after waiting another 10 minutes the operator solved the problem for me (I hope). When the call ended I was asked to rate the call \u2013 the ratings I gave were about the operator and I gave the highest rating. But I bet the general manager of 'customer service' uses those ratings to say their service is good for his/her bonuses \u2013 but it is total crap \u2013 I was just lucky to get a good operator. Qantas = best pilots, best planes, best maintenance \u2013 WORST customer service.

The trip over is a separate review and the worse behaviour by an airline i have ever experienced.\nQantas are currently flying the B787 Dreamliner on Syd/Dallas/Syd as they haven't got all their A380's back yet. The ticket prices were unbelievably expensive being the most expensive by 50% that i've ever paid and nearly double using Delta earlier in the year.

Shock #1 came when i checked in at Cincinnati when i was charged for an additional bag. I had noticed previously on the ticket it said 1 bag but the Qantas web site clearly said 3 bags for flights USA to Australia for Qantas Club. American Airlines check in rang Qantas to no avail with the guy saying they are having lots of issues with the Qantas baggage limits. Now i suspect this is because they have the B787 but it's dishonest to say 3 bags on the web site. Flight boarding was quite efficient at Dallas , the plane seemed quite clean and tidy. Meal time came along , 3 choices - Chicken Caesar salad, Beef Stew and a plant based dish. By the time they got to my seat all the Chicken had gone, i could hear others like myself grab the stew which they were fast running out of. I pity the folks that only had a choice of the plant based dish, doubt Qantas will do anything about it but lift your game on the meal choices in economy. Entertainment on board good choices. I am not sure how comfortable the seat cushion actually is. Was very happy to see my bags in Sydney.\nAm seriously considering other options for my next business trip to the USA which is sad because i tried to fly Australian to keep Australians in jobs.
