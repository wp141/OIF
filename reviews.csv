5,Qantas is back to being the queen of the skies in the world.,"We've always flown with Qantas throughout the years and they've always been good. This year after recent reports of major turbulence up in the sky from different airlines around the world; my partner and I were more cautious. However, during flights from Melbourne to Narita and Narita to Melbourne after those incidences, we were surprised how the airlines quick response and changes on how they run their flights. We went through numerous minor turbulences and during those times the team kept us informed and kept everyone (incl. the staff) safe, by keeping everyone seated. Also, the food were great and warm. Lastly, the staff were nice and our whole journey with them were smooth and pleasant.",May 2024,4,4,5,5,4,4,5,5
1,Very bad airlines and service,Very bad airlines we had booked for my parents and had asked for assistance. They did not give for both flights also their flights get delayed almost always for which thay do not provide any later arrangements. After 10 for domestic and after 11 for international they do not even provide bus assistance to commute from domestic to international. My feedback is to never book this airline,June 2024,3,2,1,1,1,2,1,3
4,Enjoyable experience,Woke up early to enjoy being a platinum member by visiting the lounge. Boarded on time and everything was smooth.Was a little disappointed with no screens on the seat. Takeoff was fine and the service was great.Got a granola bar with a drink.It was all fine until we had a bit of turbulence and we kept on changing altitudes. Landing was fine and my only advice is get screens on all your 737s.,March 2024,4,4,2,5,4,5,5,4
4,Has Qantas regained it's international mojo?,"Great flight. A380 was full. Crew were pleasant, helpful and efficient. Meals were tasty and choices were available. The days of the nonchalant cabin crew seemed to have disappeared.",March 2024,4,4,5,4,4,5,3,4
1,Never book with quanta’s again,I’ll never book for quantas again .. I thought they r good in Australia that’s why it’s abit expensive and no… it’s ridiculous for us to wait at Launceston airport for seven hours with our four month old baby to go to Sydney .. no compensation for it absolutely ridiculous,June 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Consistently unreliable,"Was booked Qantas Townsville to Cairns, then rest of flight was airnorth. Two hours before flight I received txt stating my Tsv CNS flight was cancelled & they'd send new flight details. They then booked me Tsv- Brisbane, brisbane,- Melbourne; melb to darwin. This is certainly not the first time I've had to go via this or similar route to what is normally a 2 .5 hour flight. You never know if or when your booked Qantas flights will eventuate. They are extremely unreliable.",April 2024,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,1
1,Poor Hotline Customer Service,"What happened was I booked my return flight from Singapore to Melbourne in Dec 2023. Just before flight in June 2024, there was change of aircraft type, which affected my selection of seat for both forward and return flights, which I paid for $40 per trip, so total $80.

No one from Qantas informed me about the change of fleet and hence, my seat booking became invalid. Qantas allocated my seat to other site, without any consultation and still charged me $80 for the seat selection.

Called the hotline and the customer service officer insisted that I booked the changed seats, without bothering to check and return call, even though I tried very hard to explain the situation. Before we could reach a resolution, she cut off my call abruptly. It was pure insult and poor, unprofessional customer service.",June 2024,3,3,4,1,3,3,3,4
5,THE BEST EXPERIENCE,"What can I say? I left Perth with my husband the 4th of June (noon) and EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect. On time, good food (with a vegetarian option), they offered us ice cream and tons of snacks. We landed safely in Singapore, ready for Dubai. Thanks Qantas",June 2024,4,4,4,5,5,4,5,4
3,Cramped in seat 9C,"Special thanks to service staff and crew for assisting my wife. Boeing 737, seats 9B & 9C, no window, cramped, first occasion in seven flight that there was insufficient room to lay the table flat, hence I had to forego the meal, although I did enjoy a glass of wine. Memo to passengers, you need to be no more than 80kg to enjoy a comfortable flight in these seats, not sure why there is no window adjacent 9A. Inflight service ok, my wife enjoyed her meal and drinks. Good communications from cabin crew and the cockpit during the flight. Experienced some turbulence but not major. Perth Airport needs to improve efficiency with unloading and delivery of luggage to the carousel.",June 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,Our introduction to the Embraer 190,"Checked in online and received great assistance with luggage at the airport, booking it through to final destination, Perth. Our first flight on the Embraer 190 with Qantas subsidiary, Alliance Airlines, pleasantly surprised with the roominess and comfort of seats 13A & 13B. Great cabin crew, pleasant and engaging throughout. Tasty morning snack serverd.",June 2024,4,2,3,4,4,5,5,-1
4,Rescheduled flight but no problems.,"Enjoyed the flight although it had been rescheduled some months earlier and we didn't depart Brisbane until 6.45pm./ Didn't have to worry about luggage as it had been routed through to final destination. Another DASH 8 400 and seated in 8A & 8B. Comfortable and roomy seats, tasty inflight snack, friendly cabin crew and great info from the pilot. Baggage on the carousel when we arrived in the terminal and we were quickly on route to our hotel.",May 2024,5,5,-1,5,5,5,5,-1
4,Great tail wind,Short wait at Longreach while passengers disembarked and others boarded. Remained in our seats 8C & 8D and soon in flight to Brisbane. Great cabin crew and interaction with passengers. Must have had a strong following wind as we arrived in Brisbane some 20 minutes before schedule by my reckoning.,May 2024,5,4,-1,5,5,5,5,-1
4,Comfortable short flight,"Arrived Barcaldine Airport somewhat early for the flight having checked in online. Staff issued new boarding passes and handled the luggage efficiently, booking it through to final destination, Canberra. Seats 8C & 8D very comfortable, plenty of legroom on the DASH 8",May 2024,5,4,-1,5,5,5,5,-1
4,Comfortable Dash 8 flight,"Early morning flight ex Brisbane to Barcaldine on the DASH 8 400 in seats 10C & 10D. Check-in online straightforward, great assistance with luggage at the airport, comfortable seating, adequate legroom, pleasant cabin crew and tasty inflight snack. Good information from the cockpit throughout the flight. Luggage available soon after landing.",May 2024,5,4,-1,5,5,5,5,-1
4,Comfortable flight & on time,"Heading to QLD for a holiday and booked our flights using a combination of cash and FF points. Seated in 9B & 9C, efficient online check-in, staff at airport very helpful with luggage. All good with boarding, comfortable seats but no window in the row on our side of cabin. Pleasant onboard service, good information from cockpit and cabin crew. Disembarkation very good and baggage quickly available. Enjoyed the movie on the Boeing 737-800",May 2024,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,4
2,A little booking scam exposed,"When booking, Qantas pretend to book you on the lunchtime flight from SYD to AKL however, this is the third time we've been bumped from this flight and had to spend 6~8 hours at SYD airport before we could get a flight to NZ. The booking, in our case AKL-SYD-TOK rtn, always tells you that on he return leg, you get a 2 hour transit in SYD. But inevitably you get an email a week or so later saying schedule is changed to a late afternoon, early evening flight. NOT what you want to hear coming off a long haul. Hopefully, now that this little scam has been exposed, folks will get the flights they sign up to in the first place. Sorry, Qantas, but no next time for us.",June 2024,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,2
5,Baby Bassinet Is Key Perk! Great Service and Love Qantas,"Bassinet was amazing for our 3.5 month old baby. We would not have gone on the flight if Qantas had not reserved us a bassinet. Qantas came through for us and the baby slept in it 11-12 hours way. We bottle fed him during takeoffs and landings when babies are not allowed in the bassinet during those. Very nice flight attendants and arguably twice as good as ones on United Airlines, American Airlines, Jetblue or Southwest.",May 2024,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5
1,Worst airline ever and we haven't even flown yet,"Haven't gotten on a plane yet and Quantas is already the worst airline we've encountered .. and that says a lot. They've already cost us a day at our destination despite not leaving until this coming Wednesday. How they know they're going to be delayed significantly 4 days before the flight is baffling. Their ""help"" is anything but. It is clear that they absolutely do not care. If they are ""the Spirit of Australia"" it doesn't say much for Australia.",June 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas Sucks!,"Worst airline!

Tried s many times to get help and upgrade. All I got was lies and no help. Totally willing to pay $ but they would rather fly empty than help their customers. Will never fly with them again!",June 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Poorly handled!!!,poorly handled service delayed our flight and doesn’t take any responsibility to provide us with any help whatsoever that was caused by the delay. avoid flying with quanta’s as much as possible.!!!,June 2024,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas Cancelled again - no are & no responsibility,"Qantas is 2-4-2 this month. It again cancelled our flight. The most disappointing thing was the constant lies told by the Qantas staff. We where already on airside and we told we had been rebooked. We had to go out through customs, pick up our bags and when trying to book back on found that there was no rebooking - just a lie to get us back out of airside. Now and entire flightis trying to get rebooked. Reasons give - changes so a maintenance problem has now become a weather event (not our problem)
Long or shorthall - no care & no responsibility so avoid this airline.",May 2024,1,1,1,1,1,-1,1,-1
5,Qantas Outstanding,"Travelled on May 9th 2024 Non Stop to Perth.Absolutely amazing, aircraft spotless inside,entertainment and charging points all working.The seat i had was 52F was very comfortable and plenty of leg room.The cabin crew were outstanding nothing was too much trouble.The Dreamliner is a 3x3x3 config in economy which is perfect.The cabin temp was ideal throughout the flight as was the cabin air quality.Now for the food it was Outstanding (vegan vege) possibly the best i have ever had on long haul. The crew on this flight are a credit to the airline.I would have no hesitation in flying this route again with Qantas. I confirm this my opinion and are not connected anyway what so ever with the airline I confirm this review was in my own words and not prompted by any party",May 2024,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
1,extremely dissappointment and rude,"We booked the tickets from syd to shanghai 1.5 month ago through qantas website.
However, the hassle started :
1. After booking and paid the fare,Qantas cancelled all the airlines from Syd to china !
Which gave us a big headache and had to pay extra $2000 for 4 of our family members due to its cancellation.

This is so disappointing!

2.Whats worse is we are facing financial stress after paying extra $2000 on top of air fare , Qantas yet not refund us money till now ! it has been over 2 weeks we are still waiting for the refund !

3.As a royal customers of Qantas,We will never ever take Qantas again ! And will never ever recomend to our friends and family ! Shame on you Qantas !",May 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,bravo whisky,"We travelled Qantas Airlines to Sydney first and then onto Auckland, New Zealand, we decided on Premium Economy which was nice but having also travelled economy on the Airbus A380 I am not to sure whether the extra for Premium was worth it. The service on the plane is brilliant, the food was excellent, the staff were all very professional and friendly . All in all a very positive experience.",June 2023,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,5
5,Very Good,it was very good and it's truly the spirit of Australia and the flight service was very nice we got to have some cheese and crackers,March 2024,5,5,5,-1,5,5,5,5
1,Poor customer handling,"My family who is none English speaking came to Australia to visit me in Australia, and on their way home they have got the worse experience of travelling they can possibly get.
Qantas flight was delayed over 2.5 hrs causing them to miss the connected flight, when they get off the flight they just been handed a useless piece of paper saying they have been rebooked onto Cathy pacific flight, without any boarding pass or booking reference. Then the ground floor stuff just took off, which my family has about an hour to find their own way to international airport. Then when they managed to get there, Cathy pacific told them there is no any information about the booking, I have trying to call qantas, they keep telling me they did book, and sending me some booking number that the Cathy staff cannot locate,but Cathy pacific also trying to call qantas to verified the booking, and cannot get through. Cathy pacific cannot hold off the flight any longer for someone who is not booked on the list. Then Qantas told me I have to sort out the accommodation ourself as there is no staff at the airport to help. So my whole none English speaking family just been left there out to dry at 1 am. I have to rang around the hotels to find someone who has vacancy and 24 hr reception to settle the family. After 7-8 calls I finally find something, only was able to settle the whole family in at 2.30 am.
My whole family has been at the airport since 5 pm and didn’t get any food from qantas as when they took off, they said they run out of time to do food service. No staff was available to assist and settle passengers got stranded due to their own delay.

The fallowing day I have spend the whole day on calling between airlines ( Qantas and the original connection airline) both airline both party pretty much has said it’s not their problem, I need to contact the other company… the list just goes on. Qantas did finally send me a link to choose an accomodation as the earliest flight they can get them back on is not till the night after at 10 pm. But when clicks into the page, it just showing no rooms available, so here we go another night of expenses on our own.
Also with the luggage they did not tell me what they going to do, when I finally manage to ask about 3 different staff he inform me it is still in brisbane airport, they will just send it on with the family when they eventually can get on a flight. No offering to drop the bags off to them, so they can fresh up, and if they want the bag now, I will have to call the baggage claim myself, and they probably going to ask them to pick up on their own. The family eventually just decided to leave it to save further hassle.
Qantas’s customer service and problem management is just appalling, yes we all understand flights delay or cancellation happens from time to time, but there is pretty much no help from them apart from booking the passenger on to next flight available (which is what they supposed to do)
The whole family including myself has been left frustrated and traumatised through out the whole scenario, even to make a complaint they just told you to go online. I will not be travelling with Qantas anytime soon or ever just for my own insanity.",April 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Absolutely shocking,"Literally the worst experience I have ever had flying.
Booked direct flight from Auckland to Melbourne 6.30 am departure. We live in South head so had to leave at 2.30 am to be at the airport on time. Boarded on time, Horrendous takeoff sliding and bumpy, not at all normal. Announcement around an hour into the flight in a nervous voice saying they had technical difficulties and had to return to Auckland. Obviously having to dump fuel on the way back. Horrific landing almost face planting the seat in front but also a little relieved to be on the ground. Watched for several hours while they took the engine cover off to assess the problem. I am assuming we lost an engine given the bad takeoff and landing. Nervous the whole plane hoped we wouldn't be rebounding the same plane and indeed we didn't. 4 pm that afternoon we boarded another plane to Sydney with a stopover and then onto another plane to Melbourne. We arrived losing an entire day of seeing our daughter before she leaves to go to Europe , we were only staying for 3 days total.
We arrived at our hotel 9.30 that evening totally jet lagged after what should have been a three and a half to four hour flight.
At least we didn't die I guess.
Then on our return flight again delayed, The plane had left Auckland and had to return due to issues ( probably the same plane we left on) Finally the plane arrived then we were told there was an airport curfew and if we didn't board the plane by 8pm we would not be able to fly.We had been watching our bags on the tarmac waiting in the rain luckily we had wrapped them and then a mad panic to get the passengers from Auckland off refuel and us on... boy people can be slow and have no understanding of the urgency. Exhausted and glad to be home, although devastated we lost an entire day with our daughter, I will never fly qantas again.",May 2024,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,1
1,Qantas domestic never on time,"I had a 6am flight from Canberra to Melbourne.

We were advised flight is delayed due Fog, where as Virgin flights were able to take off and land

Poor customer service and bad advise to customers",April 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Being Gold Member is not Worth the Effort,"I have put some effort into getting to the Gold Membership paying more than other airlines to get access to lounges and have more luggage, but now they are restricting the benefits of being loyal to Qantas. In the lounge only allow to stay for a short period of time and since I am using another airline I have to pay for extra luggage",May 2024,3,3,2,4,1,3,3,2
4,Improving service. Safe flying.,"I almost chose another airline as Qantas let us down majorly 2 years ago with a terrible service throughout the flight. I decided to give another chance. I am glad I did as it had improved on our last experience. The food was better, the entertainment could have been a bit better but wasn't bad. The service on QF1 was a bit of a let down. I had a staff member keep missing us on the drinks and meals so when I called her after she went past us totally missing us she didnt apologise just told me to wait. Not a good response to a poor job being done really.
On the whole the plane was clean and the flight was very smooth and I felt the captain was really good and kept us all up to date and tried to get out of any bumpy parts, which I am most thankful for as a nervous flyer.
Mostly I choose Qantas because it is usually a smooth flight and I find their captains are always very good at communicating. This is why I will choose them again over others. I feel safe.",March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,QANTAS Business Class C-,"We decided to use our Australian airline to reach Singapore in Business Class. It was a poor choice. The seats were no where near as comfortable as those on our next flight with Turkish Airlines. The cabin service was was minimalist and the much touted meals service was non existent. 4 meals were on offer but by the time they reached us it was down to one! So no choice at all. The food allegedly designed by Neil Perry, was not even a C- rating. Tired and tasteless stodge. He should check, as his product name is being used in vain. Our next flight with Turkish Airlines was a valuable comparison. Attentive, happy service, wide choice of delicious food and outstanding sleeping facilities. Another reason to take QANTAS off you flight choices!",May 2024,3,3,3,2,1,3,3,1
1,Bad experience,"-unlike other airlines that provide free seats allocation for family with babies, Qantas requires us to pay
- rude customer service and keep saying cannot understand what I'm saying even I try to spell out to them letter by letter (I was told they as Racist and this is so true)
- only can check in 24hrs before. Forced to purchase flight seats and they are very expensive
- this will be my very last time taking Qantas",May 2024,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Need improvement BIG TIME!!!!,"Disappointed with all the service from start to finish. Instead of boarding at 10.55 am, we waited until 12.30 pm. We were on our seats at 1.15 pm and at 2.08 pm ready to fly. They had some technical issues.

This was an international flight (14.15 hrs flight time) with nothing provided...eg. socks (for more commodities in economy class).

The food was horrible, not eatable...people were commenting that the same food was served on domestic flights too.
The same story was on the way back, only we departed on time. This time we bought something to eat on the plain.

Qantas has to be ashamed of flying overseas with a service like this. Fly attendants didn't show any enthusiastic customer service...acting like robots. If you asked them something about food, they looked at us surprised; no comment on any of our questions. Very well trained!!!

This is the worst experience ever. It's a time for Qantas bosses to sit in economy class and fly overseas.

We are all very proud of our beautiful Australia and do not deserve a bad reputation, because of Qantas. The first impression is the last one!",April 2024,3,3,4,1,1,2,1,1
1,Damaged baggage,I flew from Jakarta to Melbourne to Brisbane to Sydney and back to Jakarta. The handling staff damaged 2 of my Delsey luggage bags...the moment I wanted to file a complaint I had a strong feeling they were not going to do to anything because of their attitude....and how correct I was.....they asked me to complaint through the app and wait....after a week or so they contacted me and asked me to send them details and so on....emails in and out and after having spent weeks replying their email they agreed to pay me a mere fee of 27 Aud and when I wanted to fill their form it said my case has been closed since I took a week to submit the form as I was out of town for work purpose.....what sort of airline does this? After going through so much of trouble it was a complete waste if time....and it's not that their ground service is good...nor is their flight service out of this world....I would recommend u as a passenger to avoid taking this airline,April 2024,2,3,2,2,3,3,2,3
1,Qantas has a terrible complaints service! Passing the buck 101 !!,"Qantas lost my bags on the way to a surf trip in bali , I had to get a couple more flights from Jakarta to the island I was going to be at, I got to Jakarta and my bags were not there ! it was so late at night and I was by my self, I waited around for hours and asked people and no-one could figure out anything. I had to proceed to my hotel for the night at 2am in the morning with literally the clothes on my back I had nothing, both my surf boards and all my clothes were in the bags, I was so upset. I had to get on the phone to my mother in Australia to have her call qantas, they could not tell her a thing! She rung so many times and they were clueless !!! I later found out on the island that the bag had never left Brisbane ! I finally got the bag thanks to the help of the locals in Indonesia, they were so lovely as I was so stressed out, this was my first solo trip as a young female and Qantas was not helping one bit. I had lodged a complaint when I got home. They have taken months I mean 6 months to get back to me and all they can say is ""its not our fault"" contact the Indonesian airline. They have no accountability for what happened, the stress they caused and zero skills with customer service ! Taking months to get back to someone and not even taking one bit of responsibility ! I am disgusted, I paid extra so Qantas could look after me on this trip I was going to go with a different airline but I thought Id be okay with them !! Absolutely will never be flying with them again!! HORRIBLE !!",October 2023,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,2
2,9 hrs on tarmac no food or water,Qantas has become one of the worst airlines in the world. Their on board staff I have found to be pretty good but their call in center is terrible - it used to be such a pleasure calling Qantas years ago and I also enjoyed the Australian accents. On this particular flight we left Bris to have a medical emergency and landed at Noumea. We were on the tarmac for 9 hours and the staff refused to give us food or water. Furthermore no recompense was given. We flew back to Bris and our flights were reassigned the next day. absolutely appalling behavior.,July 2023,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,1
1,Qantas Jhb Syd flights always late,"Qantas flights from Jhb are nearly always late leaving. Returning to Sydney from Melbourne I have a 90% rate over multiple trips of flghts being cancelled or late.
Since SAA Perth flight disappeared this is only direct flight. Qantas never apologises. Always blames something else. Be prepared for very high stress with any transit flight",March 2024,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1
1,Don't pay the extra $$ not worth it.,"Got on to the flight Sunday morning and was on the windows seat.
A passenger that I beleive was drunk as his breath smelt of booze was seated next to me all he did throughout the flight was lean on to my side and sleep at times groping and falling on me.
I don't understand how he was allowed on the plane in the condition he was in.

On the way to Perth on the previous flight I had another male passenger approximately 6 feet tall and really broad although apologising to me had the same thing happen to me to being crushed up against the windows.
The annoying thing was there was seats without the middle seat being filled free.
You think they would put someone of that size in the seat with the middle seat spare.

9 and a half hours of uncomfortable flying I understand it's economy but I did pay for a seat not half a seat.
I do not expect to arrive at my destination with back pain because people can't be better sorted.

I will go with the cheaper carrier next time not worth paying the extra $$.",May 2024,2,1,1,2,1,3,3,1
1,Very poor customer service,"DON'T use Qantas.
Australians that we met on our long trip were surprised we had used Qantas and said that Qantas now has a terrible reputation in Australia. They damaged my case en route, made me jump through hoops to make a claim and then told me that I should have reported to staff at the time of collection (even though there was no Qantas representative at Broome airport when we arrived late in the day!).
Very poor service and client care attitude.",February 2024,4,3,3,1,3,4,5,3
2,Needs to lift their game,"The airlines level of service leaves a lot to be desired. Lack of competition in domestic routed have resulted in some entitled staff that feel they can treat customers poorly with no consequence. Not sure if it is a different generation of staff in the cabin that seem disinterested and kept skipping over seats when providing service. Also kept dropping things including one on my head...almost like they were drunk. The check in staff in Brisbane is no existent with the bag drop technology which kept glithcing and we kept being asked to try a different machine. Even after the person on the ground tried for himself and realised it doesn't work, we had to queue up with the one single manned counter in the airport.",March 2024,5,5,1,1,2,2,1,3
1,False advertising,Horrible experience with Qantas. The plane was literally falling apart. Seats were held together with tape. The entertainment system did not work for an almost 16 hour flight. They are falsly advertise their services.,May 2024,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1
1,Choose a decent Airline not Qantas,This is a discrase for business passengers. Its old school seating with aggressive Jurassic flight attendants. I never added the flight number Tripadvisor did.,February 2024,5,5,5,1,1,1,1,3
1,Try every other airline first,"Book Qantas and that but you on their Bellshill Jetstar airline. In the lineup for check in. 1 lady serving lineup so long and ome close to closing off they told people should of got there earlier. We lined up before they even opened. Plane left late. No service. Booked international back to home but had to get luggage and Check back in again.
Qantas for someone who was a loyal customer over the last year of this rubbish like being pushed to Alliance flights. Think its time to find a new airline
To add they brought one flight forward a few hours so lost almost our last whole day on holidays.... Thanks...",May 2024,2,2,1,1,1,3,1,1
2,Half of the seat,"The benefit of being a platinum with qantas, you only get half a seat.
The plane was good surprisingly, and it would be a good flight if I had a seat to myself and didn't have to share it with an oversized passenger next to me.",May 2024,2,4,4,4,2,3,4,2
1,Very Poor Airline with average service,Once great Airline now very poor. I avoid flying Qantas even if it costs more. Management dont care and have questionable practices,February 2024,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,1
1,Absolutely disgusting company and service,"Customer service is absolutely shocking! Complaints department is absolutely shocking! Do not EVER buy gift cards from Qantas as they don't allow you to add your full name to the voucher but then you cannot book the flight you want because your full name is not as per your passport.
Complaints department refused to assist and referred me back to customer service! what a joke! Company refuses to add my middle name to the voucher and refuses to provide a new voucher with my name meaning the $150 voucher my friend bought me for my birthday cannot be used at all!",April 2024,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Inferior Entertainment System.,"Absolutely appalled with the new Qantas Entertainment System. There was no screen in the back of the seat, but all passengers were provided with an I-Pad which was in the seat pocket, which had to be clipped into the seat back. However, the I-Pad screen was absolutely filthy dirty ... fingerprints all over ... definitely a health hazard.
In addition, the system was definitely inferior to the previous system: very little music, no map to follow, no camera view ... and streaming of film was slow /stop.
We deserve better than this on long flights.",March 2024,3,3,1,4,2,1,4,3
2,Poor service and not like it used to be,"Been a long term flyer, but been a few years from flying Qantas. Flight to Auckland, wasnt good. Took over 2hrs to get the food service out to a 737-800, no urgency from the staff, and the isle was blocked by two trolleys the whole time. The food 'process' didnt help them, with each meal requiring 5 pulls from the trolley to create a little stack of plastic and paper packets... not efficient. They also must have made 6-8 trips back to the galley to get replenishments for the trolley. When they got to me, was only vegtarian option left. Also found the seat pretty tight, more like a Jetstar seat so that was disappointing. As an Aussie, the old motivation of flying Qantas cause it was a good, has gone for me.",May 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Best Airline In Australia,"Qantas provided excellent service both on board and on the ground. My flight was not delayed, thankfully. As a frequent flyer, I frequently receive quality service. The staff were nice and the meat pie was very filling. I would say no other Australian carrier can get up to this standard. No other carrier provides a complimentary meal AND drinks. No other carrier has so many partners that being a frequent flyer isn't a waste. No other carrier allows 23kg of checked luggage FOR FREE and 14kg of carry-on baggage. No other carrier provides exceptional service all the way through your journey.",December 2023,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,5
3,A frank but fair review of QF295 Sydney to Bangkok economy class May 2024,"Booked a package holiday through Qantas travel from Adelaide through to Bangkok for 7 days on 1 May to give myself a special treat after leaving a job I'd been in for 13 years. Unfortunately, the 6am flight from Adelaide to Sydney was delayed coming into Sydney due to congestion in Sydney, meaning I had to literally run to get onto the 9.40am flight to Bangkok and couldn't spend any time enjoying the Qantas lounge in Sydney which was disappointing but not the airline's fault. Once on the flight, it was then delayed for an hour due to a couple of no-show passengers - also annoying - and it arrived late into Bangkok...
Qantas flies a wet-leased Finnair Airbus A330 from Sydney to Adelaide. This means the crew are primarily Asian Finnair crew not Qantas crew, but you will get Qantas entertainment and magazine (although it was an out-of-date April Qantas mag) and a pillow and blanket. The economy seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very small - smaller and with less legroom than a standard economy seat on a domestic 737 aircraft and there is a very thin bar between the seats, so little privacy. Fortunately, I had seat 33J no one sitting next to me and this was a day flight or else for me it would have been unbearable. I would liken the economy service on this flight to Jetstar economy. Don't expect to get an amenity kit or wine poured from a bottle. You will get a small plastic bottle of wine just like on a Qantas economy flight and the staff pretty much switched off and remained at the back of the plane after they'd done the lunch service. The food itself was average too. You can see the menu and its presentation in my photos below. Not even served on a proper tray. If Qantas wants to compete - and charge as it does - like a full-service international airline then it needs to lift its economy service on this international route to at least the standard of other major full-service airlines - like the Qatar Airways economy service which is terrific. To be frank, if I'd known what this flight was going to be like I would have flown Jetstar to Phuket in economy and saved some cash and points.",May 2024,1,2,3,3,1,3,4,3
2,Poor service,"Our decision to fly with Qantas is primarily due to their direct route from Sydney to Johannesburg. While the aircraft is clean, we've found the food and service to be poor. Additionally, we've encountered challenges with their level of accommodation, especially when traveling with kids. On our most recent flight, we experienced water dripping on us and inadequate air conditioning, making the journey uncomfortable towards the end.",April 2024,2,3,4,2,3,4,4,2
1,Crap backup service - this isn't a 'premium' airline anymore,"Probably the most rude and unhelpful call centre I've come across - considering I'm travelling business class - time to dump QF and start using Air New Zealand - at least they are polite and their website works well.

Expect lots of empty seats in the coming months as travellers such as myself dump Qantas.

And fix your website - don't tell me to call a number, then I call and you tell me to turn roaming on instead - dammit, you're supposed to be an international airline!

Frequent Flyer member since 1995, disgruntled and ready to put QF in the 'junk airline' bucket.",May 2024,3,3,1,1,1,2,3,2
4,Would recommend,"I hadn’t flown Qantas for some time but was impressed by the superb cabin crew. They are attentive and work incredibly hard to accommodate passengers. I felt like a paying passenger and not a number. The meals were also better than some other airlines I have flown, which is always welcome.",April 2024,4,4,3,5,4,5,5,5
2,Qantas - Not what it used to be,"My wife and I travelled to (and from) Dallas from Sydney in March 2024. Following our check-in in Brisbane, which went smoothly and had our bags checked through to Dallas, we had a domestic flight to Sydney.
Upon arrival in Sydney (domestic terminal), we had an half hour or so wait for the international transfer bus - this was quite busy and not well organized. Upon arrival at the international terminal we proceeded through immigration and security, which again was very busy. After these formalities, we went to the Qantas Sydney international business lounge, it was quite busy but reasonably well appointed for the start of our trip.
Boarding was good with business class customers following those needing assistance and through the dedicated boarding lane. We were seated in 7E and 7F, centre seats. The seats are a good size with some storage on the right hand side for small items (book, phone, tablet, etc.). A water bottle and some headphones were in the side storage too. I have my own NC headphones, so didn’t get to try the Qantas ones.
Seat was comfortable and quite spacious, lighting is good with several options. A pillow, mattress (of sorts) and light blanket were provided in plastic wrap. These two centre seats have a privacy scree which can be lowered where privacy is not required. Unfortunately, the screen between these seats would not stay down until the cabin manager wedged it down.
Cabin staff were pleasant but not overly helpful, my wife needed assistance lifting a bag into the overhead locker but the female flight attendant refused to assist, instead another passenger assisted. A welcome drink (juice or champagne) was offered prior to take off.
A dinner and breakfast menu was provided and breakfast selections made in advance. Food was good but the drinks service was well below what you would expect for a business class cabin. Aside from wine with the meal (and a very limited selection of white wine at that), no other drinks were offered inflight (this was the same on the return flight). Overall, the food and drink service on both QF7 and QF8 were below standard. A previous business class flight on this route on the A380 before COVID was far superior to this flight.
Bedding was left to us to work out with no assistance or advice from cabin crew at all. On our previous A380 flight, the bed set up was done for us, so this was another customer service negative. A minor design criticism of the bed position was that the seat behind left the footwell light on and light leaked through the gap in the plastic making it somewhat difficult to get to sleep.
The toilet was generally clean but the waste bin full on several occasions.
The flight itself was good and was on schedule arriving in to Dallas in 14 hours.
Overall, the flight was let down by the poor customer service and personal attention you would expect in business class. Significant improvements can be made. As the Australian national carrier with fairly limited competition, it is my hope that under the new CEO, Qantas drives for some urgently needed inflight customer service improvements.",March 2024,4,4,5,2,2,3,4,3
2,Comfortable but lacking in service and attention to detail,"Very comfortable cabin, clean and tidy but the service below average. No water offered until 3 hours after takeoff even though requested. Menu needs attention particularly quantity as half of the things I ordered were not available and the flight attendant said they loaded wrong items too. Comfort is great service lacking with no care or details",April 2024,5,5,4,2,2,5,5,2
2,Freeze your way to London,"I chose to fly Qantas to save a couple of hundred dollars by not flying with my favourite airline (Singapore Airlines). It was a long haul flight from Melbourne to London and I was travelling alone. The worst feature was the intense cold in the plane and the ""Blankets"" are made from some sort of recycled plastic and have no warmth. The plane was also kept extremely dark so it was like flying in a cold dark box. The entertainment was rubbish and hard to figure out where to plug in the headphones in total darkness. I ordered a special meal and it was hot and tasty but no matter how much the cost saving I will never go by Qantas on a long haul again.",April 2024,1,3,1,3,3,4,4,4
1,Flight credit disaster cannot use flight credit at the Qantas web page.,"Worst Customer service and worst cancelation/flight credit policy ever! Worse than a low cost carrier.
Had to cancel a flight due to Medical emergency.
- No Refund was offered
- Given flight credits and to access it I'll have to pay AUD125 out of pocket as an extra.
- Flight credits has limitations in usage
- Flight credits cannot be used for multi city travel ( Although the original /cancelled booking was for multicity).
- No option to use the flight credits when you try to book from the Qantas website. Your only option is to call the customer care and the call lands somewhere in Asia overseas who don't give a damn about the Aussie values and standard of customer experience. In other words, so rude towards the customers.
Really disappointed for an airlines that claims to be one of the prominent airliner. Really hopeless.",November 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Our flight was scheduled to leave at 20:25 for a 1 hour flight and was scheduled to arrive at 20:05. There above message to me advised that we were scheduled to arrived 20 minutes BEFORE we took off! Seriously? Their incompetence is breathtaking.

Just to top off the experience. My mother and I were seated in 2a and 2c. Two seats next to each other on a VERY SMALL plane (FOKKER 100). When we arrived at our seats, someone had put their luggage in our overhead compartment. These sort of issues are easily resolved. All Qantas have to do is:

1. Stop letting people bring on excess baggage on tiny domestic flights. Many of the passengers had two carry on bags. Most are FIFO are they don't want to check in their luggage.
2. Educate passengers that it’s not OK to put their luggage in someone else’s compartment.

Finally, Geraldton to Perth is 400kms and the flight cost $800 Australian dollars EACH, and you wonder why I am totally peeved off. I dislike this airline like you just can’t imagine.",April 2024,2,2,1,1,1,2,3,1
1,Bad Qantas business class flight.,"My wife and I travel extensively on a few different airlines. We haven't used Qantas for a long time so we thought that we would give it a go. Big mistake. Spent an hour in check-in line. We were given a glass of bubbles quite some time after boarding, but it took 50 minutes after take off to get another. In fact the drinks service in economy was completed prior to our service in business class.
I certainly could give Qantas a few tips, but will never fly our Australian airline again, BUT unfortunately have to fly home with them. Maybe another report, but I hope not.
Disgraceful Qantas management!",April 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Transits in Sydney from long haul flights.,"I'd normally recommend Qantas as a really good airline however, on my last trip Tokyo-Auckland and on my forthcoming on in May, while they advertise a couple of hours stopover in Sydney, they usually bump you from the connecting flight and give you one eight hours later in the evening. Not the kind of news you wish to hear after an overnight flight. You would hope long haul passengers got priority for the lunchtime flight to Auckland.",June 2023,3,3,-1,3,3,3,3,3
1,Qantas catering should have a much better understanding of Gluten free,"Qantas catering should have a much better understanding of what gluten free means. I have Coeliac disease and requested gluten free meal options. The food I was served was appalling. Every piece of gluten free bread was stale and rock hard. Inedible. I was given all sorts of weird things such as dairy free custard, I'm not dairy free, diabetic bars, I don't have diabetes. Vegan food, I'm not vegan. It was as though they just threw all the dietary requirements together. I paid an absolute premium for these premium economy flights and to have such appalling food served up was offensive.

1,TERRIBLE FLYING EXPERIENCE WITH QANTAS NEVER FLYING WITH THEM AGAIN AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE,"Horrible experience flying with Qantas, will never recommend anyone flying with them.

Summary:
We had a long multi port trip booked with Qantas from Queenstown to Jakarta many last minute adjustments including moving us to a low cost carrier Jetstar which ultimately was delayed made us miss a flight and had to be booked a hotel due to their terrible, terrible flight planning. Their digital check in system at Sydney airport doesnt even work from the check in all the way to bag drop, ultimately forcing ppl to raise their hands for assistance which leads to a chaotic queuing system being so disorganized and causing a huge pile of people frustrated just waiting to get their machines running.
Their customer service are not capable to handle issues effectively as they were not solution-oriented - only looking to solve whats easiest for her, not for the collective of the passengers,
We are never flying Qantas or Jet Star ever again!!

Full story:
We initally booked our return flight from Jakarta to Queenstown in Qantas flight and we paid a full price (not a promo fare). The return flight consisted of 3 connecting flights, from Queenstown to Sydney, Sydney to Singapore then Singapore to Jakarta.

They rescheduled our connecting flight from Singapore to Jakarta and it became a 16 hour layover in Singapore (and we were supposed to land at 10 PM SGT). So we booked a hotel room by the Singapore airport hoping to get a good night sleep before catching the flight back home.

However, on the day of our departure from Queenstown, just as we got to the airport we were told by the staff that the Qantas flgiht from Queenstown to Sydney has been changed to a Jet Star flight and it got delayed for an hour which caused us to miss our connecting flights.

When we landed in Sydney, we ran to our gate but the plane has left. We asked the Qantas staff there asking for clarity and she said “this is a Jetstar problem, not our problem”?????

In the end we got to the transit desk and sorted out our next flight (next day). Here we are today 26th of April 2024. We checked in for our flight, the kiosk machine had so many issues on it and there were a lot of lines piling up, we ended up have to get one of the Qantas staff to help.

Afterwards we had to drop our bag thru the machine (again automated but not working as it was supposed to). Mind you, this was not only our machine, it was all the Qantas bag drop machines at the airport that were not working, so again, the line was piling up.

We asked a Qantas staff what had happened and what should we do, as we’ve been waiting in front of a non working machine for a good 30 minutes. She explained a bit of what happened, and ask us to wait again for god knows how long without giving any other solutions. I told her nicely that it was not nice to wait, then she talked back to me “oh its not nice to wait?? Then find somewhere else to drop it!!!!”

What a service Qantas!!!! Never flying you ever again!!! Thats how disappointed we are with your company!!!",March 2024,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,1
1,Inconsistent security standards! Bull!,It's appaling to me that security changes from airport to airport. Was able to have certain items in my carry on baggage from fiji to sydney. But not allowed the same items from Melbourne to perth. What inconsistent bull. Makes packing quite difficult.,March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Delayed and so inconvenienced,"The fact that Qantas flight was delayed due to airplane issues. Ok. The fact that they had requested a different plane. Ok. The fact that this plane ALSO had issues that then delayed us, causing us to miss connecting flights. Happens. But the way we were just DUMPED on the airport of a foreign country, given boarding passes that are inconvenient, without having even been asked what suits us and knowing that there are direct flights to our destinations available, yet we get to fly to an extra stop! SHOCKING!!! I should have arrived at 8:15am and at present the arrival time is 23:15pm! All the while there is a direct flight from Doha to Sarajevo. But why not inconvenience people even more? (Due to a technical issue on a Qantas plane and no fault of ours)",March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas has the key to representing Australia well but doesn't use it,"I know qantas notoriously does not have the greatest service but this time travelling with them on QF 61, I am more than taken aback by the service, and not in a good way.

I am of Asian descent travelling to Brisbane from Japan. I was handed a Japanese incoming traveller card without being asked and then when I asked for an English one, the cabin crew said, as we are running out of these cards so it would be nice for you to just use this translation if you could read Japanese. Then very begrudgingly handed over an English version to me, and did not give a second one to my family member.

First of all, why do you run out of these legal documents for passengers when your aircraft is only half full?

Secondly, isn't it very presumptious in this day and age to assume all asians who are travelling from a certain country be able to speak and read Japanese? Asia consist of many countries. To follow through with that kind of logic, why don't you give Japanese travelling cards to the whole flight, including non asians, as we might all know the Japanese language flying from Japan? It seems like the qantas staff culture is very backwards still compared with airlines from the rest of world.

Thirdly, after exiting the plane, we were locked in the passage way corridor for quite awhile before a crew member remembered to unlock the security door for us to step into the airport.

Lastly, we were told the wrong baggage carousel.

I love Australia, and Qantas being a airline representative of the country really need to step up much more as a company.
(Hopefully not discouraging the few good staff inside the company)",April 2024,1,2,2,1,1,3,2,2
3,Where is the Old Qantas service?,"As an Australian I to love Qantas, however now I would prefer to fly (when available) other airlines. Since Qantas have introduced the Dreamliners, I find the sears on the small side (compared to Emerites A380 and the amenity within the seat cramped. Whilst many other airlines prioritise luggage for business class passengers, seems each time I fly business class Qantas my luggage come off almost last (Flight from NY Sydney it took 2 hrs after I had disembarked the plane). The scheduling of flights is also lacking, (again my experience of NY to Sydney, stopping over in NZ after flying around 17 hrs then to be delayed, plus then having to get a bus from the plane in Sydney (no direct gate) was really a ‘long haul’. (Much better when you changed in LA - at least you got a gate on arrival, plus some exercise during the flight instead of at the end). In my opinion Qantas was a much better airline before Mr Joyce changed what was good (eg stopovers, seat quality) - quality service. On local Qantas flights there is no point in paying for a higher quality seat, unlike many of its European counterparts it seems not to put those who pay for service receive that service.",January 2024,3,2,2,2,2,3,4,4
1,Poor customer service - not surprised,Half empty planes and I needed to get back to Brisbane for a family emergency! No one wanted to help “ only flexi flights allow you to get an earlier flight explained my situation and don’t care” att he help desk at Melbourne and at the gate of an earlier flight! Poor form Qantas extremely poor form,April 2024,2,3,4,1,2,4,1,3
1,Never again,"Qantas flight QF76 which left Vancouver for Sydney on 13 April diverted to Honolulu. Allegedly 1 of 3 major electrical systems failed and the plane had to land. We were closer to Fiji at the time but Qantas decided to turn back to Honolulu. We went to Qantas's hotel and the flight was rescheduled for 27 hours later. No problem. We were told by Qantas staff that buses would pick us up at the hotel the next day to take us to the airport at 7:30am. However, no buses showed up. We received no contact from Qantas but a rumour went around that the flight was delayed. We received no texts, or emails about the delay and the Manage Booking page which not work for anyone on our flight. A rumour went around that our flight was leaving later that day. Everyone went to the airport at their own expense. Bags were checked and people went through security. After multiple hours of waiting, the flight was delayed again as Qantas had sent the wrong plane from Sydney to bring passengers back to Sydney. The rested crew were unable to fly that type of plane. Finally, a message was received by email saying that flight was delayed until 9am the following morning. People left the airport at their own cost. We went to the airport the following morning at our cost again. This time the plane did take off. But not all passengers were told by text/email about the new flight. They were asking passengers to agree to stay in Honolulu for extra days at check-in as the plane was smaller than the one that had flown us in from Vancouver. Due to the failure to communicate, there were empty seats. On the flight back, we ran out of catered food. I fly frequently and have never seen this happen. The stewarts had not even reached half way down the plane when they ran out of one choice... People who ordered special meals did not get same as this information was not transferred from our original Vancouver - Sydney flight to this new flight. At the time, Qantas was saying that it would reimburse us for taxi's to the airport, food, nights accomodation missed in Sydney... Qantas is now refusing to pay. It will not even reimburse me for my seats which I paid for but did not get. I, like most, have travel insurance. However, there is an excess. I have been diddled too many times by Qantas. At the beginning of the pandemic, I agreed to leave my credit with Qantas as I thought it would help with cashflow and help maintain the Qantas. In response I was offered an extra 25% credit on top of the credit I would get for my cancelled flight. I went to rebook afterwards when Qantas resumed international flights. I found that the price of flights for people using credit was higher than for people booking and paying with a credit card. I booked several domestic flights in early 2022 which were cancelled and got to no refund/credit. I used to love flying Qantas. The food is good, when there is sufficient available, and the frontline staff are nice. However, the inflight entertainment is not great compared to other airlines these days and they treat customers terribly. Qantas is a mess and I will not fly them again.",April 2024,3,3,2,1,1,3,3,1
2,Lack of compassion and humanity.,"I had to travel to attend a funeral in Fiji. Because it was a bereavement, I booked a flight at short notice and was charged a fare of $3036 economy return. Since there was a online booking issue, I had to call and make the booking. There was no compassion shown by the officer. Response I got was because I was booking for a flight a day before the flight that’s why it would cost $3036 instead of the $875. How could I have booked any earlier? Do we know days/weeks before if someone would die and we would attend the funeral? Other airlines have seats available for such emergencies and do not charge such astronomical fares.",December 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Horrible delays,"Worst flight I have ever experienced. The flight was delayed by 4hours and they didn’t even give us an explanation for the reason for the delay. We had a connecting flight from our destination and of course we missed it and to pay a hefty amount for a new booking.
We would advise to avoid Qantas or be prepared for delays and losing time & ‘money.",April 2024,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1

3,Qantas' tired Sydney international lounge & tired; cramped fleet of 737's.,"On arrival at the Qantas business lounge I asked if any delay to my flight ""def not all on time!"" 60 mins later; ""Due to the late arrival of this plane will be a slight delay"". This will have been known when I first enquired.
Lounge announced flight boarding, I arrive at gate - not boarding for another 10 minutes! Not the 1st time this has happened
Seat 6C - IFE only partially working. couldn't watch half the content.
Food was good and tasty, although passengers thought they were getting a burger when told one of the choices was the ""Beef Burger D"".. should have read Beef Burgundy or why not call it beef casserole.
Crew were polite and a young chap Chris was a cut above. He was excellent!",April 2024,2,2,3,3,4,4,3,3
1,Qantas - LATAM strange arrangements,"We flew with 2 kids from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Our flight was suppose to be QF27 Sydney-Santiago and KL702 Santiago-BuenosAires. The company does not take seriously the leg Santiago-Buenos Aires. I've heard quite often of people getting automatic cancellations for their flights, so LATAM can take over those passengers with LA477. Indeed that was our case. Always cancellations happen in Santiago or even when you are still flying. The flight attendants inform you of the cancellation and the LATAM flight that you need to take (they give you no option for change). We waited in Santiago a few hours and we lost our connection from Buenos Aires to our hometown. We asked, requested for another Aerolineas Argentinas flight we knew had available seats and they said we had to take LATAM. Very dodgy! Looks like an intern arrangement between Qantas and LATAM.

We have to take now the return flights. Let's see what happens now.",March 2024,3,3,4,1,1,2,1,2
2,"Great, but aren't there for you when they break your luggage","I like Qantas, I do. I mean, I like Emirates better, but Qantas is great. HOWEVER.... They let you down with their terms and conditions with certain things. For example, I travelled business class a few days ago and my 2-year old luggage (good quality brand that was not cheap) arrived damaged when I returned to Melbourne - one of the lock/latches was ripped off, so half of the metal was sticking out of the lock.
I lodged a request for damaged online, thinking I would get a voucher to have it repaired or something (as that's what other airlines do), but I get an email that basically says ""Sorry, but that doesn't fall within our T's and C's"". So this is what their exclusions are (copy and pasted from their website)

- cuts, scratches and dents;
- damage to retractable or fixed luggage handles;
- external items missing from bag, e.g. wheels, feet, locks, zipper and zipper tabs, straps or name tags and
- damage to the inside contents of a bag if the item(s) were not suitably packed for transportation.

So essentially, if anything happens to your luggage, guess what... They don't care!",April 2024,4,4,2,2,3,4,5,2
1,Abuse use of cabinet and not in accordance with tickets.,"My family bought 3 tickets on the same roll. We are expected to have the cabinet up our seats to put our stuff.

However, they are ALL occupied by someone else of other seats. There have around 5 bags already placed inside our cabinets ( supposed for our 3 seats!!).
The crews seem did not care.
Finally we put our bags underneath our seats and squeezed. This is unfair. No one really check on the ticket seat numbers Vs the allocated cabinet. My question is there is no need to buy extra luggage if qantas allows such abuse uses of cabinets. This is the first time I have such unpleasant service. The flight from Sydney to Cairns is very disciplined. The crew did remind the passengers only allowed to use their allocated cabinet ( with their seat numbers).",April 2024,3,3,2,1,1,3,3,3
4,Excellent Long Long Haul Flight,"After travelling 32 days throughout Australia and New Zealand, this was our 17.5 hour direct flight home.
The crew were friendly and welcoming.
The seats were comfortable in a small section of the plane between Business and Economy. Good leg room, comfortable pillow that attaches to headrest and lots of reachable storage. You are also provided with a small wallet containing eye mask, socks, toothbrush/paste and a wonderful lip salve. Also provided was a warm blanket, something much needed on all the Qantas flight we took. (London-Singapore, Singapore-Sydney, Sydney-Adelaide, Adelaide-Brisbane, Brisbane-Auckland and Sydney-Perth)
Dinner and breakfast was provide with a good choice together with appropriate drinks offered. There is a self serve pantry for snacks including Tim tams, fruit, hot pastries, drinks etc.
Crew regularly came round with water and juices to help keep you hydrated.
Excellent seat back entertainment with a vast choice of films, tv programmes, audio etc. It also prompts you via wellness channel to keep hydrated, stretched and when best to sleep.
Embarkation was straightforward but if you do not qualify for Qantas lounge, there is no pay per use lounge available at the terminal.
Disembarkation was good except for collection of baggage which was a long wait.",April 2024,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4

2,27 hour delay,"Travelling from Vancouver to Sydney. Due to technical issues the flight diverted to Honolulu for 27 hours. Qantas has sent the same flight change text multiple times. We have a meal voucher. But no hotel vouchers or buses. The 2 staff on the ground are very nice but are not being kept up to date with hotels/buses. We have no idea what is happening and some people have babies. 250 odd people are just sitting at the bus terminal at the airport waiting with info/ time estimate. No water…. We cannot leave as we need info.

Other than this the actual flight was good.",March 2024,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4
5,We thought QANTAS was brilliant!,"Having heard so many stories about the decline of QANTAS we were not expecting much for our BNE-PER flight. We however were very pleasantly surprised and loved the QANTAS service and experience.

QF Check-in staff polite and courteous at BNE. Easy transit through security.

Boarding was efficiently organised, and we quickly settled on board our B737-800 aircraft. Seating very comfortable. This older aircraft had no seatback IFE but an announcement on boarding (and the free Wi-Fi) told us to download the QANTAS entertainment ap, which we quickly did before a/c doors closed. A great line up of movies and TV shows which kept me entertained. Free (and fast) Wi-Fi in flight was a real bonus allowing me to catch up on emails and surf the internet.

Drinks service, then a hot meal offered. Then more drinks and later on a Kit-Kat snack.

Cabin crew very friendly and attentive.

Flight on time.

We left very impressed with our QANTAS flight.",March 2024,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5
2,Qantas kicked me out of my Business Class seat to give me a middle economy seat,"I booked a Business Class flight using my Frequent Flyer points on 9 June 2023 for travel on the 8.35pm direct flight from Sydney to Darwin on 9th April 2024.

I book Business Class seats because of my size and to be close to a toilet for health reasons.

On 9th February 2024 Qantas advised that my that they are no longer operating the 8.35pm direct flight on 9th April and gave me no reason but as they are operating this flight on other nights 11/12th April etc, it was probably because they had insufficient passengers booked on the flight which is understandable due to the high prices for flights to Darwin they are now charging.

I was moved to the 10.40am flight BUSINESS CLASS from Sydney to Adelaide to connect with the Adelaide to Darwin flight – a long travel day. As I could not make the 8.15am direct flight from a Cruise I was getting off at Circular Quay I made arrangements to be collected by a private car and taken to the airport instead of using the train (an additional cost).

What occurred when I got to the airport is inexcusable and disgraceful and Qantas should be ashamed of themselves for the following:
• At 9.15am I arrived at Sydney Airport, checked in and handed my luggage to a lovely lady on the Counter who handed me my two boarding passes for my Business Class flights – Syd-Adel and Adel-Darwin plus my luggage ticket – all good and great service
• I proceeded to the Business Class Lounge where I stayed until it was time to board the aircraft to Adelaide
• At 10.15am I proceeded to board the aircraft and was pulled up and told my seat has been changed and I am now sitting in seat 4E – a middle ECONOMY seat on a full plane – no explanation, no reason was given – bloody disgraceful
• I boarded and was told to take my new seat 4E and the lovely hostess was surprised I had not been notified and I asked her to find out the reason.
• The last passenger to join the aircraft was a Qantas employee who proceeded to sit in my original Business Class seat 1D – they kicked my out of my business class seat (which was booked 10 months in advance) so that an employee of Qantas could take my business class seat – disgraceful, bloody disgraceful conduct by Qantas.

How can they issue me a Boarding Pass for Business Class at 9.15am then by 10.15am think it is OK to kick me out of my Business Class seat so that an employee can sit in comfort – why do they think this is acceptable – IT IS NOT.

• The hostess did come back to me early in the flight and said she was told that they had been trying to ring me to let me know of the seat change – this was an outright LIE as my telephone was turned on all the time, I had wi-fi and was in the Business Class Lounge – no reason was given for the change.

Whilst I supported Joyce for doing what he could to keep the airline afloat during COVID, the endemic lack of service appears to have gotten a lot worse and Qantas has forgotten what industry they are in – the SERVICE industry.

There can be NO EXCUSE for what occurred; being kicked out of my business class seat booked 10 months in advance after already been inconvenienced due to a flight cancellation so that a staff member can sit in comfort and given a boarding pass for my business class seat.",March 2024,4,2,2,3,1,5,1,3
3,They take no ownership of customer care,"Travelled as a family of 5 to HK and arrived back to Melbourne today. I ordered a vegetarian meal which was vegan and left on my table for probably an hour, making a poky space even smaller. On the flight back our plane was delayed 3 ½ hours meaning we had to return leaving 1.30am Melbourne time. The seats are so small that my husbands shoulders were jostled by everyone who walked past. I had to try to sleep with my knees rammed up against the seat in front of me. The most annoying thing was that I called Qantas Sydney from Hk when I found out about the delay and asked if we could use the Qantas lounge as it’s very late for the 3 kids. She said she’d have to put me though to Frequent Flyers to do it and they would email me. I asked her could she just do it as I’m in a cafe on my mobile in HK. She put me on hold then said to ask the gate staff to help me. I got to the gate and they couldn’t do it. I asked the lounge staff lady if I could buy passes since we had now gone to the airport 5 hours early. She said no, it had to be done days in advance. Honestly, every effort is too hard, the seats are small, and I’m never flying Qantas again if avoidable. Take a cheap airline and buy the really nice food that’s available in the airport and take that and save yourself the expectation that you’re paying more for a good airline.",April 2024,1,2,3,2,2,2,5,3
5,Best cabin crew ever,"Absolutely amazing service!! The cabin crew was by far the friendliest and engaging crew that myself and the wife have ever come across on our travels.

Food was delicious and presented beautifully! The seats were clean and comfortable.

Highly recommend flying with Qantas in first class it’s an experience of a lifetime.",April 2024,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5
1,Qantas changing seat allocation withouth advising,"I have a booking with Qantas and have noticed that they have moved us from the seats we orginally requested in windows to the centre of the aircraft. We always sit and request window seats when we fly, so I have called Qantas to request a change of seating to which they told me that they couldn't process it and sent off a request. We don't fly in the middle of the aircraft and as we are paying for a business class ticket and paid well in advance, we chose our seats and I was advised that Qantas are geting quite a bad reputation with cancellations, seat changes, delays etc and was told to check every that my booking has not been changed without notification. They have not advised us of the seat change and I cannot send a complaint form through as it stops me from progressing and tells me to call (which I have done to no avail or confirmed change to my original seat request).",March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Screwed for Medical Emergency Changes,"I will attempt to express my dissatisfaction, disappointment, annoyance, furiously angry, especially being p…d off at Qantas policy on a medical emergency response.
My husband had an altercation with a Mercedes SUV on his bicycle and lost. He now has a severe spinal cord injury and we can’t take our original return flight of April 13th. We want/are deferring our return by a month (mid-May). After his follow-up appointment at the RAH Spinal Cord Clinic. So I contacted FlightHub, on-line, who we booked through. They were very helpful, but came back with a message from Qantas. “We do not make fare changes for medical emergencies”. I have medical certificates/documents to back up our claim.
The return portion of our air fare is approximately $2250 for both of us. Qantas’ “offer” for compensation is $15 each; yep you read that right $15. Apart from being ridiculous, it’s an insult. We have to start from scratch and book a one way fare each to our long distance destination to the tune of approximately $1700 each.
We spend 6 months in Adelaide (October to April) and 6 months in Toronto, Canada (April to October). We have been doing this routine for the past three years, and plan to keep this up for a few more years. We will NEVER fly Qantas again. I am so angry that we are not cancelling our April 13th flight, we are going to be “no shows”. I am not going to give them the opportunity to re-sell my seats. Is this the ‘sprit of Australia’s customer service? There’s no comfort in “We sincerely apologise”!! Then CEO Vanessa Hudson said “I know that we have let you down in many ways, and for that I’m sorry”. Gee – I feel so much better knowing that. I’m selling my shares (at a loss) just on principle.",October 2023,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
4,Good Flight,"Bag drop was straightforward
Embarkation on time and without issues
Seating comfortable with storage allowing you to keep essentials to hand. Comfortable blankets, necessary as plane temperature was cold.
Very good entertainment provided
Dinner served with a smile, choice of drinks and appetising.
Breakfast just right.
Disembarkation easy",March 2024,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4
1,Bad Service Qanats,"Qantas, as a frequent and dedicated Flyer. I am disappointed with the service of
the food that was served on a 8 hour flight. The 2 hour delay, we can deal with..
The food that was served was not only frugal, the taste was below standard..

Just as well we had an early dinner at Manila Airport..There was no Breakfast served
In the Morning.. We were suppose to arrive at Sydney Airport at 6.40am.. Did not arrive until 10.30am..We received a small Crousant In a Cardboard box.No Coffee Or Tea, Honestly, what's happened.. Allen Joyce retired, so you decided to what, cut back on keeping your customers happy.

My wife and I travel to the Philippines twice a year. And travel to the USA once a year.

Lift you game.. You are supposed to be One of the Best Airline Companies In the World.",April 2024,2,2,3,4,1,1,-1,1
1,Not good.,"Our flight from Sydney to Noumea on April 3 was on time but the food was terrible. As I write this comment I am still at Noumea airport on April 8 for my return flight to Sydney which was scheduled for 2.50pm. It is now 5.15pm and the plane hasn't arrived from Sydney. We were told the flight which was originally delayed one hour will now take off at 6.25pm from Noumea. It doesn't look.promising. If it is not delayed flights, it is lost baggage, cancelled flights and terrible food. Is this the legacy that Alan Joyce has left behind for Australia?",April 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Disgusting staff along with the supervisor,"Airlines staff don’t even have knowledge about the transit visa conditions, delayed me for 2 hours without any reason because of which I almost missed connecting Flights from Sydney. Staff didn’t even apologise for their mistakes. Staff along with the supervisors were so rude in Brisbane domestic airport. Because of these incident I was so much panic, frustrated and angry at the same time . Will never ever board on this airlines ever again.",March 2024,1,1,2,1,1,4,1,-1
1,Best to Worst,"Qantas has always been THE airline to make the trip from the US to Sydney or other points down under. I have an upcoming trip and automatically chose Qantas. My interactions with them for this trip have been awful. I was double booked- Qantas error, charged twice for the same flight, have yet to receive a refund despite over two months wait, multiple calls and promises. In addition, there have been errors with the itinerary. It seems to me that Qantas has a case of Long Covid",April 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Another story of a flight not refunded.,"Another story of a flight not refunded. Cancelled the returning leg of an international flight and was told by Qantas we would be refunded $1200 for each of the two flights. Refund has never materialised. Complaints led to generic correspondence saying our case had been considered and there is no reason seen to change the outcome (i.e. no refund). No reference to the flight booking, reference number, previous conversations with staff. The customer service from this company is beyond reprehensible and only possible in a company which effectively cannot go out of business.",August 2023,3,3,2,4,1,3,3,3
1,Dreadful plane terrible uneatable food,"I just returned from India with Qantas..that airline was the worst cramped A330-200 I have ever been on..The food was curries both ways served by New Zealand crew
I could not eat the food it was discusting
I was so cramped in my seat it was unbearable
Why New Zealand crew on an Ozzie airline of course the get paid less than Australian crew
The were frumps no make-up over weighted and no smiles
What the hell has happened to Qantas never again keep my points o will go back to Sinapore Airlines..
Melbourne airport was a joke Qantas sent us to Melbourne to get our Delhi flight 2 hrs late
Qantas as bad as Iran 🇮🇷 Airlines ..",March 2024,1,1,2,1,1,3,1,1

5,Great Airline - Great Staff!,"Having come off an Air NZ flight from Christchurch, it was soo nice to fly with an airline that didn't feel budget! Firstly the seats were better padded and felt slightly wider. The crew were friendly and had genuine warmth about them. Everyone got complementary airline meal which was tasty and adequate and free tea/coffee. Beer or wine. Because they had food left over they offered seconds to everyone if they wished, which is a really nice gesture and sets them apart from other airlines. Flown Quantas many times and never been disappointed!",December 2023,3,4,3,5,5,5,5,5
1,Constant delays and cancelations,"Worst airline I have ever traveled on.

If there is another option I encourage you to take it.",March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Very Good,IT WAS VERY GOOD DESPITE NOT ENOUGH LEGROOM AND NO KIOSKS AND NOT HAVING THE TV SCREEN ON MY PARTICULAR FLIGHT IT WAS STILL AMAZING AND IS A SOLID 10/10,March 2024,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
1,Very disappointing Qantas Business Class,"There’s few options available to go from Sydney to Buenos Aires. You either go Qantas direct to Santiago and onwards to Buenos Aires changing airlines, or by Latam which stops en-route in Auckland, and then transfers you to one of their smaller aircraft in so-called premium economy to Buenos Aires. This time we chose Qantas .
The flight is with their 787-9 Dreamliner which is very comfortable in Business Class. So it should be, as it is much dearer than Latam which I have also flown with.
The flight left late after another gate change at Sydney. One would think that Qantas having Australia as its base would have more pull with the operator. So one hour later with the usual absence of announcements we set off. Our seats were 12E& 12F, at the rear of business.
During the purchasing process through the Qantas website we trie to change the seat allocation but were unable to do so.
Seat 12F is somewhat broken, as is the one across the aisle, but thems the breaks!
As I am old (80 years) I ask that arrangements could be made to get to our connecting flight in Santiago, and am assured this will be taken care of with a motorised unit. Remember we left one hour late and we now have only 60 minutes before our connecting flight departs.
Dinner is served and our snappers arrive floating in a sea of corn purée. They are only just edible.
Breakfast arrives. My wife’s was minus the orange juice and cold and disgusting. Totally inedible. The steward departed briskly, and never returned.
I’m still eating for mine as all the tables are cleared. I managed to find a steward who hastily delivered mine, without cutlery, vanishing immediately. When I eventually managed to find a young stewardess they were hastily delivered, 10 minutes or so later.
By this time the cold toast and scrambled eggs had got even colder and I asked that it all be removed as it was not fit for eating.
Our steward was notably absent and never reappeared. I was offered a hot coffee as compensation - which I accepted )one neede something to eat).
It is worthy of note that during the 12 hour flight the premium economy passengers marched through business class to use the toilets all night long.

All other airlines I have flown on treat their business class passengers as valued customers. Not Qantas.
We have flown Aeroflot and Siberian airlines and have enjoyed far better service.

Naturally when we arrived at Santiago nothing had been arranged for our transport. All the cabin staff could say was that “we’d better hurry”.
Not quite what I expect to be delivered to an 80yo with a heart condition.
We did eventually get to our KLM flight, being the last passengers to board.
The difference between Qantas and KLM is huge. KLM were very good on the short one and a half hour flight.

I’m not looking forward to my return flight in a couple of weeks, I can tell you.",March 2024,5,3,4,1,1,4,1,1
3,Average experience,This was a domestic flight connecting the next day to an international service. They got us there delayed and the awful snack of salsa and corn crackers has reappeared. Priority tagged bags came off fast in Sydney as we were overnighting there. They got us there but nothing special.,March 2024,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,1

1,"Cancelled flights, delayed flights, poor customer service, worst frequent flyer experience","Qantas is the worst airline, between all the cancellations, loosing luggage, destroying musical instruments. They also have my phone number with the wrong country code so i cannot authenticate any account details and I asked at the airport, at the lounge, called their numbers and they cannot help me. This is so very very frustrating. Since their price is quite high, I will use alternatives whenever possible incl. encourage my work to do the same. Do NOT recommend this airline",February 2024,3,3,2,1,1,3,1,4
1,Indigestion and Misplaced Luggages,Bad food leading to indigestion and luggages were misplaced. The food that was served were the chicken with potatoes which were very hard and difficult to swallow. Luggages were misplaced and not sent the next day due to not checking their system.,March 2024,1,1,4,4,1,3,1,1
1,SQUASHED for 9 HOUR FLIGHT😡,Absolutely disgusted by being expected to sit in a chair with no leg room as it it and then to have to be squashed write into the chair because the chair in front reclines squashed like a sardine for a 9 hr flight would not ever take quanta's again just to make an extra buck they do this to there customers it’s wrong I don’t expect first class seating but to do that to an old man with leg surgery and then staff complain that he’s upset about the seating and him being angry about the lady reclining the chair was disgusting they made the seating like that knowing well it’s uncomfortable and expected people to not get upset when people reclined the chairs they should not of made the seating arangement like that to begin with I will never fly with them again,March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,A 5 star Qantas flight,"We used our points to fly to Jakarta to pick up a cheap flight to Europe. The business seats on the A330 are comfy and great movie selection. The food was tasty, but clumsy presentation and my main dish did not match the menu description... they will ask for this to be sorted.

The reason for the 5 stars is thanks to one flight attendant, Joey. Once I told him that my mum loves Qantas and now can’t fly due age, he found us a hat, keyring, amenity bag, PJs, playing card and wrote out a card for her. So thoughtful. Nice to see a Qantas staff member with a personality.

Priority bags came off fast in Jakarta.",March 2024,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,4
1,ANYONE BUT QUANTAS,"On the night of 13th March 2024 we were out in Queenstown (NZ) enjoying a meal when at 9.45pm I missed a call from Quantas. I then started to receive emails but as my phone was on silent these went unnoticed.
I took my phone out for a photo and noticed the missed call. I subsequently telephoned the number. I was informed by the Quantas desk that due to industrial action our flight the next day (1535) to Sydney had been 'cancelled' and we were now scheduled to fly to Auckland and we had to be at the airport by 7am the next day, which was 9 hrs later. At no point was I asked or offered an alternative flight or given a choice.
Given it was our last night in Queenstown and we were out enjoying ourselves this had to be quickly curtailed so we could arrange a taxi for the morning. The following day we were due to leave at 1300hrs for the airport so we had booked an early 9.30 shotover jet ride. Given the time frame we could not cancel, had to rearrange the taxi and miss the hotel breakfast.
We arrived at the airport and explained to the Air New Zealand Rep that due to the flight cancellation we had been booked on a flight to Auckland. The Rep was very surprised and said the flight had not been cancelled and was confirmed. By this stage we could not return to our hotel and had to continued with the arranged flight to Auckland, which it was then announced was delayed.
We were instructed to collect the proceeding flight tickets from the Emirates Desk at Auckland Airport (there isn't one) when we arrived.
On arriving we found firstly there are no flight desks, only baggage drops, which only open 4hrs before the flights. We arrived at 12.50 and our onward flight was not until 9.05pm.
I check the flight schedule and found we could have been placed on a later flight to Auckland at 17.20 (our bags would have been checked in) which would have allowed us to enjoy our planned day and trips, instead our previous night was ruined, it was almost impossible to sleep the night before. We had to scramble for a taxi, miss breakfast and then had to wait an inordinate time at Auckland airport. Not even able to go through to departures.
would I use Quantas again....No you cannot TRUST them.",March 2024,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Misleading and Illegal Conduct,"Do not attempt to change your flight! Their customer service is prone to illegal conduct and will mislead you. I was under-quoted for a flight change which I paid, only to be told that they had made a mistake in quoting me the fare difference which was actually 5 times the price I paid. This is after my original flight was cancelled and they put me on the new flight. Qantas is now holding my booking until I pay this fare difference despite the illegal deception. Customer service is an absolute joke and I will never be flying with them again. With 1 week to go, I am waiting for my call recording to be reviewed and I will be taking them to court otherwise.",February 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Rerouted and Refreshed with Great Airport Loune,"My connection in Melbourne was missed through no fault of mine.

Nancy gets a big shoutout.",February 2024,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,4
1,Worst airline I've ever flown,"First, and last time flying this airline. Booked our flights 6 months out and they cancelled and rebooked our flights twice. The second time caused us to have to juggle our vacation plans significantly, costing us money. They charged us another $200 just to choose our seats on the rebooked flight because they said we didn't pay the ""upgrade"" the first time we booked, which we did. The ""upgrade"" charge was only to sit together on our 13 hour flight, not a better seat.

The service was ok, food was horrible. But the worst was the seats, which were extremely narrow. I had to sit with my arms crossed because even tucking my elbows in, my shoulder still got bumped by every person and drink cart that came by.

When sitting, my knees touched the seat in front of me, before they even reclined. I'm 5' 8"", not that tall. I sat like a sardine for 13 hours. It's unconscionable to have that little leg room on an international flight. Thankfully my connecting flight in LA was with Delta, and I had literally 3-4 inches more room on a domestic flight, economy seating. (See photo one vs two)",March 2024,1,1,3,2,1,2,2,1
1,Extremely disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with my Qantas flight experience. Despite booking two months in advance to visit my parents in Adelaide, the flight was canceled two days before departure. The only options provided were inconvenient and resulted in a shortened visit and a poor seating arrangement near the toilet. This experience significantly impacted our holiday plans and left us feeling let down by the lack of responsibility shown by Qantas.",March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,terrible booking operation and customer care,"They change prebooked seat without telling customer and refunding. I happened to know my seat number was changed when I reconfirmed the booking.

1,Avoid Qantas like the Plague,"We were booked to fly business class from Adelaide to Auckland via Melbourne on the 7th March 2023. After check in we noticed that the flight was changed to QF670 and the first leg of the flight was changed from business to economy. When I queried this at the service counter in Adelaide the Qantas staff were unhelpful. We were finally boarded into the last seat of a fully booked flight. My wife had to go to the middle of the flight to put her hand luggage into the overhead locker. She being vertically challenged short the help of the hostess to put the luggage into the locker who point blank refused to do so.
I think that they had two schedule flight from Adelaide to Melbourne at approximately the same time. Both flight were probably not full and therefore cancelled on the fully fill the other. A case of profit dam the customer.",February 2024,1,1,1,1,-1,1,1,2
3,Food not suitable for human consumption,"I have no complaints about processes or staff whatsoever but the food was totally inedible. Scrambled eggs, tomato, sautéed mushrooms and potato. I’m trying to find out if the scrambled eggs are made with some powdered egg substitute because they did not taste or feel like eggs. The whole meal was inedible. I cannot believe they serve rubbish like that. Don’t even bother serving food if it’s going to be peasant slop. What an insult to be served that muck! Sort yourself out qantas. Taste the food you serve. Not happy at all!!",March 2024,2,2,2,4,3,5,4,1
4,Pretty good experience overall,"Hadn't flown with Qantas for some years but their deals for a trip to Perth back to UK were the best both for arrival / departure times & total cost when we booked months ahead of travelling

It was only the return legs that were with Qantas as the outbound flights were handled by Emirates .

My only real complaint was the extremely slow checking in at Perth International terminal which was worse than snail pace. It was enough to turn us off from using this airline again before even getting on board!

The flights themselves were fine. Food perfectly acceptable & cabin crew friendly & professional in my view. We had exit row seats which offered plenty of space especially on the final lengthy journey time into Heathrow from Singapore.

In my opinion Qantas sit just below Emirates but well above BA for overall customer experience . Would fly with them again.",March 2024,4,4,3,4,4,4,2,3

Since then on phone for 2.5hrs to get old seats back in Economy. Those seats were no longer available and we were shocked to find our flights from SGP to Cairo were cancelled and our 427,000 points were returned to my account. What a nightmare! Have since found we have seats to SGP but at the arse end of the plane. No clear idea of travel on to Cairo. Would you travel with Qantas after this? Never ever again....",March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Months before the flight Qantas advise the plane will take off later. Ok.
On the morning of flight they say it will be 20 minutes later. Plane coming in 17 minutes late.
Get to gate and they are now 30 minutes late.
Then there is an engineering problem. Later still.
Then they say engineering problem fixed but now refuelling. Later again.
Then they offer coffee vouchers and advise that take off is later again. No reason given.
I go up and ask. Told there is a new engineering issue.

5,Nicky from Hervey Bay airport. Great customer service,There were delays but I was very early. Nicky from Qantas at Hervey bay airport walked up to me without me asking for help and asked me which flight I was on. She then offered to swap my flight to an earlier flight to reduce delay impact all completely without me initiating.

1,See you next Tuesday Qantas,"Haven’t even left yet but already the worst experience. Booked and paid for extra legroom seat 9 months ago, but have just discovered by accident they have moved me. No notification and now
Sitting apart from my sister. We specifically booked the seats with extra leg room so we could sit together, and customer service don’t give 2 flying f’s and no solution offered. Just reading from a script and zero ability to actually help. An absolute cluster f and will be travelling on a 16+ hour flight next to some random. Thanks Qantas.

They tell you what you what you want to hear with no intentions so please be aware when booking, they can't always give you what you pay for. False in every way.

4,A good flight for once!,I enjoyed the Canberra lounge as it was quiet and food was good. The plane was empty and was one of the Alliance operated E190s. Comfortable seat and used the entertainment app. Snack was cheese and crackers. My priority tagged bag came off second in Hobart. A miracle! Overall a good flight and even arrived early.,March 2024,4,4,5,4,3,4,5,4
3,What is it with Hobart bag drop?,"This was a flight operated by Alliance Airlines for Qantas with the Embraer E190 plane pained in Qantaslink colours.

The experience started badly with ground staff at Hobart no longer acceting check in bag until 2 hours prior to departure - I thought only Jetstar did that? And it is not the case in Canberra so why in Hobart? So I was left for 40 minutes before I could get through to Qantas Club. Annoying and outsourced ground staff just don't care.

The plane itself was good with more legroom that other QF planes and a wine was offered. But the horrid corn chips and salsa have reappeared as the ""food"" on board. I used the entertainment app which was good.

On arrival in Canberra my priority tagged bags (as Gold member) was one of last off. Why do they pretend that they do priority bags? All the non-priority bags were offloaded first.

Well they got me there, but it is just like a bus trip...",February 2024,4,4,4,1,2,4,1,2
4,Overall good experience.,"Cabin crews are very courteous and helpful.

1,How I went from a raving fan to a complete hater of Qantas and why you should never pay for Business Class,"It all started 2 months ago with the best experience of my life. LOL. I saved up a lot and went to the Gold Coast business class. It was magic. I waited 65 years of my life to find out how the other side lives. Large huge seats you could fit 2 people in. Delicious food, perfect service where even the stewards knew you by name when you go on. Faultless and I decided there and then that I only wanted to ever fly this way and that Qantas Business Class was the only way to go no matter what I had to give up to afford it.

Well, it all went downhill this time around. I had to go to the Gold Coast again for my course and I decided to save up and go Business Class again. I looked forward to it all week and was so excited. I went on Friday after work to the Qantas Lounge. It was perfect just like last time. Then that is where it stops.

Got to the plane. Nowhere near the level the last plane was. I might be a little naive as I do not travel much and I thought that all Business class was the same standard. No it it not. Small seats, no separate cabin, bad service and noisy kids. By now, I am thinking ""why did I pay over $1000 for a return domestic one hour flight?"". This is so far removed from Business Class and the experience I had before it is not funny, and I paid more than last time.

So when I got to the Gold Coast, I called Qantas. The person on the other end gave me an email I could complain to and said that children should never have been in Business class. Ok, I would have to deal with it on Monday and I was resigned to having a bad trip on the way home. I did not realise HOW bad. No wonder Qantas has such a low star rating.

I got to Gold Coast airport and Qantas decides not to open their lounge for customers who have paid for this. They open it up one hour before flight and you can only stay there 20 mins because then you have to board your plane. REALLY, but hang on I paid for this??????? So if you come 2 hours beforehand which is what you are supposed to do, you cannot access what you have paid for.

Announcements are given rudely and late. I went to board and then even though I was there before boarding was due to start, they had started early and I did not get priority access and had to wait in the Queue. But I paid for that?????????

Then on the horrible plane, crying baby. When I complained because I am in business class and I have paid extra and I am quiet and not disturbing anyone, I got abused by the Stuart who started to shout. He said that I should keep my voice down because I would upset the people I am complaining about. I said that his voice was louder than mine and that he was the one causing the scene. I merely made a POLITE request. He then said that if I dared answer back to him he would call the police, have me arrested and that anyway he was not giving me any food or drink to teach me a lesson. Apparently if you pay for something, do not get it and other passengers are being disturbing you have no rights to say anything.

True to his form he did. Not only that he broke all codes, yelled at the top of his voice explaining his version to the police so that the whole plane could hear and stopped everyone from disembarking for 15 minutes as he was lying to the police. The police dismissed the whole thing by the way and said that there was nothing to investigate and that I did nothing wrong.

The rude Qantas person on the ground refused to give me the name or number of the person in charge at the airport because they knew they were in the wrong. So I went to speak to the person in charge of International who was horrified and said that he would definitely not let this slide.

The person at Domestic also told me that the person on the phone did not know what they were talking about and children and babies are allowed in upgraded cabins if parents pay or that they even upgrade them as the cabins are smaller and there are less people to disturb then in coach.

So if you pay a fortune to fly an upgraded class, you should expect them to put screaming babies and badly behaved children as they don't want to disturb coach but it is ok to disturb you who has paid 3 times more. You should not complain and ask that other passengers behave because that will get you to have to talk to the police and embarrass you walking through the airport which I guess was the aim of this rude person which should be sacked.

You will also not get Business class but a pretend Business class and you will not get access to a lounge which is what you have paid for. So not quite sure why I paid so much????? Hmmmmm!!!!!!!

I explained to the rude Stewart that I am respectful, I am quiet, I do not disturb anyone, in fact when asked if I wanted the reading light on before take off, I said that I could read with the light in the window as I did not want to disturb the person next to me. That is the level of my respect so expecting the same in return I don't think is too much to ask for. He also said that if others are rude and noisy that is ok, that I should not complain and that I should take a private jet.

Never fly Qantas and definitely don't pay for an upgraded compartment because you will rarely get what you pay a fortune for. If coach is better, has better service and if all screaming kids who can't sit down and be quiet and screaming babies are automatically put into Business because there are less people to disturb there as I was clearly told then what am I paying for?",March 2024,3,3,3,1,1,5,4,3
3,middle of the round experience at best,"Been a few years since i flew QANTAS business, this flight was an A330. Food and drink options was great, service was dependant on who was looking after you, unfortunately for me i lucked out and the flight attendant was rude and not willing to help with the basics (how do i pull out the hidden tray table). Inflight entertainment options were fewer than economy on Emirates, especially when it came to music. Not impressed to be honest given the other carrier options.",January 2024,5,5,2,1,1,4,5,5
5,Enjoyable short flight to Brisbane,"SYD-BNE. Boarding was smooth and there was a good welcome once onboard the aircraft. There were 3 rows of business class seats in 2x2 configuration, the seats were comfortable with a reasonable amount of legroom.

Pushback was on time, shortly after takeoff service started. Dinner was served on the flight, there were two main course options available and I chose the asian style pork which was delicious. The meal came with sourdough bread and boxed carrot cake for dessert. A full bar service was available throughout with plenty of top-ups.

The staff were attentive and friendly, and there was a good amount of announcements during the course of the flight. It was an enjoyable short flight to Brisbane.",February 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas poorest airline in the world!,"To start with a brief summary: Qantas cannot be trusted, they happily take your money but wont adhere to made contracts.

I made a One World around the world booking through Qantas. The journey starts in Stockholm, goes on to Hong Kong and from there to Toronto and New York before returning to Stockholm.

The booking was made in January and Qantas happily took my money for it. Note that all legs were CONFIRMED. A few days ago I received an email that some changes had been made to my booking. And not because of schedule changes, no, I had just simply been moved to much worse connections and even departures on another date than originally booked!

When talking to representatives at Qantas I get attitude. They say ""there is nothing we can do except issue a refund"". I have received no valid explanation as to why they think they can enter a valid contract (by taking my money for confirmed flights) then just breach it without any respect for their customer.

The (invalid) explanations I have been given are that ""it was not us, it was the system"". As if you can blame a ""system"". Ridiculous. The second one ""we don't operate the flights in the booking"". OMG! If you sell something that includes parts from a supplier of yours (flights of other airlines) and confirm the sale to your clients then you have made a contract. If you confirm flights operated by other airlines it is too late to track backwards.

Trying to book the same routing now would cost at least the double to when I booked it. I am currently looking into how to file a complaint in Australia, or maybe even start a legal case there.

I am outraged right now and will not stop my chasing down staff at Qantas who can actually have a conversation, so far I have only talked to extremely unhelpful and unfriendly staff ""advising"" me to get a refund.",March 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Pilot tried to take off while overloaded, caused engine failure, and a rough emergency landing. They off loaded cargo, three passengers disembarked refusing to fly on that plane. With a lightened load and after a 5 hour delay finally took off. Then, to add insult to injury they lost my luggage. That turned into a mission trying to find that.
Terrible on board food, surly staff, dangerous take off and lost luggage. QANTAS should give other airlines lessons on how to screw up on every level. Shocking and disgusted.",March 2024,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

2,Codeshare luggage issues,Flew with Qantas/WESTJET as codeshare partners from CBR-YVR. Unable to clarify baggage policy per either carrier prior to departure then informed our bags would be in breach of excess luggage due to neither carrier recognising each other’s baggage policy.

1,"Qantas you have lost your shine, remember we are your customers","I am so disappointed with Qantas , its customer service , have been a FF member for years , travel with Qantas, , had the worst experience.. with Qantas ground crew who were rude and unresponsive , they refuse to board my niece who was a permanent resident of Australia, after showing them all the evidence and cancel her flight leaving her stranded in Singapore. Customer service was supposed to call me in 24 hours took them 3 weeks , it took my minister to intervene to bring her home , causing us additional expense. When they contacted me they insisted I get an authority from my niece which took me more then 7 days so they try to cancel my complain,,,,,,I have requested them to reinstate it. I even wrote to Vanessa Henderson with no reply....:(

I agree with the other reviews about their flights , the seats are tiny, I purchased extra leg, I am a medium built women, the tray was so tight, no room for ipads, the plane was so overcrowded , Qantas has lost it touch....I am so disappointed and am not sure if I will fly with them again but I have been collecting points for so long ......",January 2024,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2

I am not a large woman and I was totally boxed in unable to even use the armrests. There were pillows on the seats, but absolutely impossible to put them anywhere but on your lap! My seat didn't have an iPad, after requesting one they eventually brought me one that had a broken charger cord and couldn't be charged and said ""this is all we have"". The food was ok but served in a cardboard box with a wooden fork and was difficult to eat with so little room to move. What happened to large trays with cutlery and tea cups and dessert, and a hot towl to wash your hands and face! Thank God for the free wine is all I can say.

1,Qantas experience.,"Their connecting flight was missed due to a delay in Auckland. The pilot on our flight from Auckland came on the intercom and said that all the people flying to Los Angeles had nothing to worry about because that flight was also delayed. A very rude attendant met us at our gate and told us to keep moving and go away. We had no idea where to but were aware that we would not be on the flight to Los Angeles. A 13 hour trip turned into a 25 hour nightmare. Qantas made no apology but justified their actions with their legal obligations and their contract with us. They decided to fly us to Melbourne first and then to Los Angeles. With multiple delays ( 5 hours in Sydney and 5 hours in Melbourne, and flying to Melbourne for 2 hours). The other “option” was to stay in Sydney, fly the next day, and go Coach instead of Business Class. In business class (a $7,000 ticket for each of us) we received very poor service. For most of the flight we didn’t see a flight attendant. When we asked for a piece of bread, or something, they came 20 minutes later.
Just a horrible experience.
One lady at the check-in counter in Sydney told us that she felt bad and gave us gift cards worth 90 Australian dollars … they were invalid. We have tried them several times. This is what Qantas thinks of their full paying customers!? Never again.",February 2024,5,5,3,1,1,3,1,3
2,Outdated aircraft and food,"oh dear me. I booked Qantas not because they were the cheapest, but I thought I'd pay a bit extra for extra service. they are the national flag carrier after all? pretty shocked by what I found - This was my first time flying Qantas long haul.

firstly the seat that I was in was broken - didn't recline at all. another passenger behind me on the return leg had the same problem so obviously they don't check and fix these kind of issues between trips. reclining is vital for comfort.

this was an a380 but must have been very early model which hadn't been updated. the usb is in the arm rest which is very inconvenient. modern planes have it next to the screen. but in any case mine was broken - so no power for the whole flight. good job I had my battery.

so I tried the on board video. it really felt about 10 or 15 years out of date. it was pressure sensitive - not like modern phones or pads which are capacitive touch sensitive. so to register a press I had to press hard into the screen, then it took about 10 seconds for it to register, by which time I'd pressed again , so it registered it twice, and then took me somewhere else.

the screen resolution looked about 300 lines - very fuzzy and grainy. no detail at all.

also, why are you advertising FORK LIFT TRUCKS when a video starts??? who's going to be buying one of those on a flight??? ""drinks, perfume, jewelry, fork lifts anyone?""

and please spare us the tedious 'safety' video which is full of qantas employees' 'my magic place' . no one cares, just go the safety video. it just makes it tediously long so you're less inclined to watch it.

food. grim. I've flown emirates, Thai, Japan, Singapore and others and I always get a collection of several dishes along with the main. like fruit, bread, crackers, the main and a dessert. Qantas just plonked one tray which was just the main in front of me, and a lump of bread - with NO BUTTER! what am I meant to do with that? just eat it dry?

the cutlery was wooden - yes the same you get from a take away on the street. the same useless knife and fork which are unable to cut and stab as is their purpose. I know they're probably going all eco with this, but it's better to have metal cutterely which actually works, and can be reused thousands of times. I don't want to feel like I'm at my local chippy.

the final insult was the Qantas app refused to show me my boarding pass on Singapore so I had to wait to get a paper copy. no error just no button to show it. worked fine all the other legs :/

Not only is it impossible to speak to someone (our only option was to email customer care) they simply do not care about their customers. We cancelled a booking and were under the impression that the credit lasted 12 months. When we tried to use the credit it had expired much sooner than the 12 Months we expected and only by 2 days. They refused to extend the credit despite. We explained that we needed to fly for a family emergency and had a young baby in the mix with financial hardship. They couldn't have cared less, stuck to their arbitrary rule. We have always been loyal Qantas customers and it's no wonder customer satisfaction is waning.

I was for sure not happy with all those changes and request for Singapore Airlines flight to JKT but Qantas ground staff told me that there is no seat available on either SQ 950 or SQ 956.

And guess what, when I checked directly to SQ website, there are plenty available seats that I can choose to fly. I believed Qantas HAS LIED to me - and perhaps another passenger.

it such a horrible practice! with all the troubles of cancellation, longer hours flight and then now you were trying to downgraded my seat? is it your way to decompensate your frequent flyer?

2,How hard is it to fix a bassinet?,"I flew Qantas return trip from Heathrow to Singapore and back. I booked a seat with bassinet, seated in a row of 4 with another bassinet. Flew out on 6th Feb and the one next to me was broken. Felt so sorry for the family next to me. My husband’s tv was also broken (fantastic for a 13 hour flight) which they knew about. How it wasn’t fixed I don’t know. Obviously no care for the people travelling with them.

On the way home on 19th Feb we flew back same seat. Sat down realised must have been same plane as the bassinet next to me was still broken. Poor lady next to me was travelling on her own with a young baby. They moved her about 2 hours into the flight but moved another lady with a young child next to me as far as I could see was not a switch with the other lady (child was too big for a bassinet) it was a night flight my baby was asleep (along with my two other children) the other passenger had her light on from the back of her phone on, was so bright having a full blown conversation with the hostess so loud. Most people around us were asleep, if your moving people around in the middle of a night flight do it quickly without noise and disruption to everyone around you. It’s just polite to be aware of your surroundings. If the bassinet was fixed the First Lady wouldn’t have had to move and no one would have been disrupted. The floor in front of me was sodden with water couldn’t put anything on the floor apparently was from the chillers. Not really my problem sort it out so all my stuff and children’s bits aren’t soaking.

1,I would rather walk.,"Qantas was several hours late and left the bags at the airport. They did not put any checked bags on the plane. The entire flight was out of pocket due to missed connecting flights, work commitments, holidays etc. Requested a refund as clothes and everything else was in the bags that they didn't put on the plane. Took several months to get a reply. staff lying, making excuses etc. Offered a 20-dollar refund. These guys are a joke. Never flying with them again even if someone gave me a free flight. Customer service??? Got hung up on several times and it's the customers fault somehow. Read the title I'd rather swim or walk than pay for the horrible experience and the way you are treated.",December 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Will never fly with them again!,"I have an upcoming booking with Qantas, and have had to make 3 calls to sort out the booking, only to find on the final call that one leg of the trip had been cancelled but that was not clear on my QF app or online when I logged in. Finally, I have had to re-book the whole return flight. I assume, similar to the ACC Enquiry into Qantas, that I would not have been told about this until a day or two before if I had not persisted. The only thing that tipped me off was the fact that I did not get an automatic flight confirmation and when I logged in and requested one the missing flight (which I had paid for) was not shown. So still up to their usual tricks. God what a mess. I will NEVER fly with them again. Shocking to see this Australian icon completely run into the ground by such shocking mismanagement.",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,The worst airline in the world.,Just worst airline in the world now. I would rather walk than ever fly Qantas again. Alan Joyce destroyed the brand.

1,Qantas Cyber breach,"Qantas may have had a cyber breach. I paid for a flight through their Ap and confirmed with my bank ING, they received the funds, but they are saying they didn't receive the funds.

Since I booked 31st January, the price of the flight has doubled and they are they sent only an email saying I had 24 hours to contact them to keep the flight. Their phone line wait time was 7 hours last time I called.

I waited and spoke to them but they haven't resolved it.",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Qantas did not help to source another way home, didn't contact us by phone- left us hanging out to dry.
We had to source our own alternative way on jetstar (even though they are part of same company we were price gauged for our return trip)- no sympathy , no help, no nothing..

The flight to Sydney was delayed 3hrs, so went straight to sleep without food or a drink on the plane. Sydney to Los Angeles started well with happy, friendly service and a glass of champagne and meal orders taken but then took 2 hours after take off to get a drink, 3 hrs before I got my starter, 4hrs to main and they “forgot” to serve desert at all. I self served my own wine as my call button went unanswered for an hour - not what you expect for the cost of business class.

1,Their pilots strike became our problem,"Qantas changed our flight due to their pilotes going on strike to a smaller type aircraft, resulting in us having no basinet for our baby to sleep in (which we specifically booked).

We had to pay extra for her bag because apparently its one bag per adult person only.

We received zero help from any staff whilst having to carry our baby, hand luggage and a folded stroller up a stairs in 40 degrees.

The toilet contained a diaper change facility so small that half our baby was dangling off the edge.

In the last 10 days, I have travelled on four Qantas domestic flights, and not been able to eat a single item - even the rice crackers had milk in them. Beef sausage roll, chicken sandwich, egg muffin… no thank you. Then on the way to Hobart, there was an olive dip with crackers and crudités - looked good, but the dip was made with eggs and the crackers were milk-based.

It really shouldn’t be difficult to provide just one vegan option.

1,Total Incompetency,"My mother In-Law passed away suddenly a week before our trip to Gold Coast, I called Qantas to cancel our flight and it went smoothly, was told refund will be processed within 6-7 days, at the time I remember thinking that was easy, maybe too easy.

Well I was right, about 3 or 4 days later I received a ”prepare your flight” email from Qantas, so I called Qantas again, was told my flight has not been cancelled due to the original request was not processed correctly by the first Customer Consultant, and she re-assured me that now it definitely has been cancelled and I will receive my refund within the next 6-7 days, I really didn’t have the energy to argue why it should be another 6-7 days considering it was not my mistake that my flight has not been cancelled 3 or 4 days ago.

A week later after the funeral, I realised that I have not received refund from Qantas, here I go calling the 3rd time, I was told by the 3rd Customer Consultant that the 2nd people didn’t get my credit card details therefore my refund couldn’t be processed, when I asked why has no one contacted via phone or email from Qantas? She replied “sorry, I can’t tell you that:”

I have been a frequent flyer since early 90’s, how a simple cancellation can take 3 calls and twice as long to get the refund, these so called “Customer Consultants” or “Specialists” are incompetent, total lack of knowledge or skills, it’s a disgrace for a business that was built on customer service and confidence to treat paying customer with total disrespect.

My fellow travellers, lodge complaints, write reviews, I know these things takes your precious time away from your family and things you love to do, but as paying customer this is the only way for us not to be treated like idiots, force Qantas to lift up their game and “ keep the b******s honest”.",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Incompetence of Qantas Customer Sevice,"Booked a flight from Brisbane to Sydney for the National Day long weekend in Sydney. Paid online via Qantas PayID system. Transaction went through with Qantas confirmation online but didn't receive the flight ticket. Called Qantas Service Desk a couple of times. They misguided me, saying it'd be better to launch a complaint via Customer Care to resolve the issue quicker. Once a complaint was filed, they changed tune, telling that this issue was with Customers Care and it would take 10 to 15 days to resolve. I hadn't received any refund after 15 working days.
The PayID payment failure happened to me twice by now.

1,Broken chair in Premium economy for painful knees,"Qantas has become awful since Covid, the lost all the service they had left from the customer service on the phone to the steward staff.
I booked an upgraded premium economy seat for my daughter and myself for the long Haul. This took years to accumulate this experience.
The reason was a medical one due to needing bilateral knee surgery.
When I arrive the seat was broken as well as the leg rest I required so not to get a DVT.
There were over 10 places available to move to, the steward said we would do so once we were in the air.
Before we could move they bought people up from economy and filled all seats.
I had someone in front of me that fully reclined. and my chair could not that literally locked me in my chair and my Tv screen was at navel height.
I never slept a wink and with unprofessional crew talking about their co workers it was the worst enviromentI have ever been in.
I love qantas. I have asked for a credit or something of value with y points back and they have declined.

1,Not so good experience,"Not a good experience. First time on Qantas Business Class and it will be my last time with Qantas. Paid top dollar for Qantas Business Class and I expected a reasonable service and received very poor service.
In a past I have received a better service on economy class with other airlines,
We left Los Angeles (on 3rd February 2024)’ for a 15:55 hours flight to Melbourne Australia .after about 2 hours we received our first meal (qantas staff not helpful or friendly ) then for the next 12 hours we never heard from them or come around to see if we okay or need anything.
And one hour before landing in Melbourne we received our breakfast which I had to rush to finish up my breakfast it because was time to get the cabin ready for landing. The food was good but not enough I was still hungry after my meal and didn’t get a chance to ask for anything else because we needed to get ready for landing ,,
I am very disappointed with the whole experience , I did expect premium service after I paid premium price for my Business Class Seat

We called the customer service and eventually got through after 20 plus minutes. Upon getting through the staff member confirmed is was indeed going to cost an extra $2000 to move the flight forward 6 hours. When questioning the price she stated we not only had to pay the flight change fee on all 3 tickets but in addition, the same again for the return flight. We argued that we weren't changing the return flight to no avail. We effectively had to pay a flight change fee and fare difference on 6 tickets. Their reasoning was that it was one booking so they had to alter the whole booking. Don't use them... their service has been in steady decline for years.",February 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

It took me so many emails over weeks and hours waiting on the phone ( once for 90 mins) and repeating my story to fix this error.
The Jakata office did not send the promised reissued eticket in an email as promised.

So repeat and repeat the frustrating cycle again, and again.
Such poor quality service and after this I was refused to put me on to a manager to assist.
No way to get help on line or by phone which was stressful when I needed it to travel and ringing from India.
Then on the flight itself the inflight screen handle did not function, hard lumps of overcooked beef were served, and when breakfast came no drinks I asked for water it was an issue.
Flight attendants slept in the flight so getting service hard.
Then I tried to report this afterwards and I was brushed off and offered $50 credit, no thanks to that! Just don't use Qantas, as its dropped its standard.

Both in Sydney and South Africa the assistance refused to push her gossiping right in front of her saying they are not going to push her she is to fat she had to walk this is physicaly impossiblefor her as she can not walk with severe spinal injury. How disgusting are these employees my mum has a illness and does not deserve to be body shamed. Even worse in South Africa the exact same thing happend and my mum had to bribe (pay )the assistant to push her in the wheel chair. The Pilot had to comfort my mum as she was in a state when she eventually made it to the aircraft at Sydney. I don't know the pilots name but I do want to thank him for his emphaty for I'll and elders I highly appreciate your compassion. As for these so called assistance you are disgusting and have no heart. I don't know how you sleep at night.

Flight was average - streaming entertainment and wifi is good, sausage roll meal and a bottle of wine.

I am tired of Qantas being late with no consequences to them. Time to bring in an EU-UK style penalty regime for air delays.",February 2024,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3

However, recently the onboard experience has declined and I've noticed a lack of available reward seats for my personal trips. Additionally, the convenient quick transfer tickets to regional airports via Sydney have been eliminated, resulting in significant wait times, often 3 hours or more in Sydney airport.

As a result, I now actively choose to avoid Qantas unless it's my only option. REX has become my preferred airline.",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

I needed to cancel these tickets and looked on their website for advice. The website clearly stated ‘As a Qantas Frequent Flyer, you can cancel for any reason within 24 hrs of making your booking and we’ll waive the cancellation fee’. There were no asterisks or T&C warnings to make me think this statement wasn’t true, so I cancelled the flights.
Only to be charged a massive cancellation fee.
I lodged a complaint online and their answer was still ‘no’ as there were ‘hidden’ T&Cs apparently

The flight was supposed to depart from New Delhi at 18:45 on 4th February. First a 4 hour delay then another 5.30 hour delay. Took off at 5am on 5th February. They gave us a hotel booking and 50$ food voucher as the connecting flight to Adelaide was unavailable until 630am on 6th Feb. When we reach the hotel at 2am 6th February there is no food. What's the point of the 50$ voucher. Now the connecting flight to Adelaide which was scheduled to depart on 6th February 06:35 hours (QF 673) is suffering from some technical problems, while the passengers have boarded the plane and sitting cluelessly of what's happening.

The seat back in front of you is so close, viewing anything on the screen is difficult. I felt cross-eyed after 14 hours in flight. The food is terrible. Better to serve no food than the rubbish handed out. I get that I need to lower expectations when flying economy but I’m still a paying customer, not steerage.

1,Dreadful contact centre experience,"The Qantas website froze in my browser as soon as I clicked submit for my booking.
No big deal, these things happen.

So in order to secure a booking I rebooked and paid again.
Try to get someone on the phone.
I'm in Abu Dhabi. Nobody answers the Abu Dhabi contact number, nor the Dubai contact numbers listed on the website.
I sent an email. No response for 48 hours. Then when a response came it said call us in Australia on 131313 which is a number that cant be dialed from within the UAE. I dont know if you can dial it from other parts of the world but I wouldn't connect from here.
Each time this was using up my minutes on my phone. I became less and less happy with each unanswered call. Each call cost me money.
After 11 days of calling the local numbers one eventually answered. Surprise surprise, they couldn't help but gave me a number to call in Australia.
When I got through there I gave the staff answering my booking number and explained logically and in order the sequence of events.
Amongst the things that person asked me was, so you didn't get a booking number.
""I gave it to you and you read it back to me phonetically"", was my response.
At this point I was ready to give up.
They don't listen.

2,QANTAS CHANGE - STILL NOT EVEN CLOSE TO GOOD ENOUGH CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Previous travel by Qantas NY to SYD was a pleasant experience, you had your own check in and seamlessly got onto the aircraft. CURRENTLY the check is a long line in a small part of the terminal (JFK) with no priority for senior FF. Our trip involved a sub-standard check in (the staff were slightly incompetent). While the flight was OK to NZ (an unwanted stopover), the trip from NZ was delayed, the plane parked (after over 20 hrs of travel) on the tarmac with a bus to the Sydney terminal. Once in the terminal, we waited over 2 hrs for our luggage. Pretty bad, however, worse to follow. My husbands (labelled priority) ski luggage did not make the plane. So after waiting and being told to go here there and everywhere by airport staff, he finally complained/reported absence. One week later the luggage arrived - it HAD NOT been put on the aircraft in NY (labelled sent 21 Jan, 4 days after our flight (obviously Qantas does not care about regular customers luggage) even though bag labelled priority. When the luggage arrived in Sydney, there was not even an apology from Qantas for the loss. Even a standard letter arriving with the luggage would have been welcomed. Contrarily when we flew VIETNAM AIRLINES my husband left his kindle on the plane and it was couriered to the resort the next day. We are currently wedded to Qantas through its strangle hold on the Australian market and would welcome change. After 10 days I have still not received a response to the complaint I sent to Qantas (there must be thousands before me).......The Australian Government should be actively encouraging competition from other Airlines as Qantas is not up to the job. As an Australian this is really disappointing. Do not fly Qantas. Added to the above the Dreamliner seats are also much narrower than the previous A380 - (which to me was a much better flight experience).",December 2023,3,2,2,4,2,3,2,2

There is no option to speak with an Australian manager, all customer service is abroad. We repeatedly needed to repeat ourselves. The staff are clueless as to what's going on.

I would not want to go to USA in them. The entertainment is good with loads of movies. Catering good with a hot meal and ice cream.

The issue was a rolling delay which meant we didn’t take off until over 1.5 hours late. A short flight time resulted in being 1 hour late arriving.",January 2024,3,3,5,4,3,4,4,5
1,"Dirty, substandard and a little bit racist","I was flying to Australia for the first time and I had a choice between China Eastern and Qantas. I wanted to try Qantas because the regularly feature in the top airlines. After trying them, I’m convinced they are bribing their way into the top airlines listings. The experience was so bad. It felt so budget and grimey.

1. They emailed early on the day of the flight to say the entertainment system was broken and to prepare. This is crazy for a long haul flight and the plane came from Sydney so how could they not have addressed this issue before flying to China. So nothing worked. No movies, no map, no safety video. Also, on board they said people should download on Netflix knowing full well that Chinese people have no access to Netflix. So basically they ignored the problems Chinese people might face.

2. The seats were one of the smallest I’ve ever sat on. It was so tight and the whole cabin felt cluttered and poorly laid out. In addition, the material of the pillow meant everything was sticking to it so it looked really gross and dirty. The toilets were also super gross and the whole experience felt unhygienic.

3. The meal was appealing I can barely put it into words. Usually I take a photo of my plane food as generally I like it. There was just one container of meat or veg or whatever you ordered and a piece of bread. No nice tray or cups or no presentation at all. The breakfast was the same. Really below expectations for a long haul flight.

4. The plane left shanghai over 2 hours late. Nothing was offered for these 2 hours.

5. The cabin crew were nice but quite inattentive. While waiting to go to the restroom, a Chinese lady asked for hot water. There were a lot of cabin crew and not one person helped her even though it was obvious was she needed and she asked. After about five minutes someone helped her. They seem to prioritize white people so if you fall into this category you’re lucky.

6. I complained about my experience as it was so terrible and the flight wasn’t cheap. They offered my $100 travel credit which can be used on a future flight. I’m not from Australia and I have no plans to return in the near future so this isn’t really helpful.

To conclude, Qantas is a really disappointing airline with a terrible service, dirty and compact cabins, poor food quality and they seem to be on the racist side from what I could see. I would never fly with them again. Fortunately after landing I had a good experience in Australia. It’s a shame that this airline is the first thing a lot of people will encounter when coming to Australia. If possible fly with any other available airline.",January 2024,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,1
1,How much does QANTAS profit from withholding refunds?,"I cancelled two return flights on the 21st of November last year, giving four weeks notice so that the seats could easily be resold. My travel agent has made repeated requests to QANTAS to refund my payment. My communication directly with QANTAS was extremely unhelpful and dismissive. It's been over two months of waiting so far. I feel quite foolish for being one of the middle income earners who still thinks of QANTAS as the 'Spirit of Australia'. I convert my retail purchases to QANTAS points and have a Frequent Flyer account. More fool me!",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Awful Airline,"Avoid Avoid Avoid..!! Day before we were due to fly had an email to say flight had been cancelled, no explanation as to why. Flew out the following day from UK to Singapore. Arrived in Singapore and one of our suitcases did not arrive, rang Qantas airways to be told our suitcase was still in the UK due to the luggage label was missing. Thirty six hours later suitcase was delivered to our hotel with said luggage label attached…! Five days later we flew to Sydney, When getting our suitcase from the Carousel, our suitcase was minus wheels and a large crack and a huge dent across the middle of it. Terrible airline will never fly with them again",December 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,QANTAS did not provide boarding passes to international flights by multiple airline,"My partner was travelling from Brisbane to Budapest via BNE-SIN-IST-BUD. She was not provided all boarding passes by QANTAS ground staff in Brisbane. It seemed QANTAS ground staff had no any idea what can be done and advised her to get boarding passes in either SIN or IST or re-check in IST with drop off baggage. My partner almost missed the connections as she trusted in what QANTAS people told her but in Singapore it turned out QANTAS gave her misleading and incorrect directions. No one was going to give a boarding in Singapore and Istanbul until she made a big drama in SIN at the airline desk.
So, if you travel with QANTAS make sure you get all boarding pass. Keep complaining until you get all otherwise you will be in trouble and your trip may turn into a nightmare because QANTAS just want to get rid of you.",December 2023,3,3,2,1,1,4,1,3
5,Great Qantas flight,A five star experience for once! Made possible by 2 nice staff members - not the usual robots that work for Qantas. Lovely checkin at Hobart and fun kooky flight attendant (Susanna) on board. Flight arrived early! Banana bread for a snack and the entertainment streamed fine. See Qantas you can do it!,January 2024,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,4
1,Disappointed with Qantas service,Had a flight from Melbourne to Wellington with my family we had a really bad experience as first they offered fruit platter and sausage and egg when they come to us and they run out of fruit platter which is the only vegetarian choice we could eat and especially my daughter they wanted fruit flitter and there are out of it as. I fly Qantas frequent flyer a lot I am very unhappy and a dissatisfied,January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,First time flying with Qantas,"Worst airline in the world. Flight attendants were rude, and disgusting food were served. Seats are narrowed and uncomfortable. The crew were hurried to cover the emptied seats, simply they were afraid of the passengers might have moved and occupied those seats. And, literally I had to use the flashlight from my own phone to get into the toilet. The whole entire floor was dark. Horrible experience!",January 2024,2,2,2,2,3,3,5,1

4,On time,"I flew economy with Wantas from Melbourne to Brisbane using frequent flyer points.

I requested an exit row window seat with the extra leg room upon check in and was granted seat 13F at no cost.

Flight departed and arrived on time.

I was served a pumpkin feta spinach breakfast muffin with a Coke Zero.

If Qantas were more competitive price wise I would use them more often.",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Worst first travel experience in Quantas,"They have worst experience on check in we are travelling with infant but as it's long fly we did book a separate ticket as well but they denied to allow 3 kg infant bag stating as you booked seat we won't allow this one.They don't bother about anything you are travelling for first time or so they just want to make money by asking additional charges to it.

They have worst services as for laptop bag also they want only laptop and laptop charger to be their no mobile phone and charge allowed .

Not recommended to anyone",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,1,2,3,1,1
5,"Happy with service , change of flight.","On 8th Jan I decided to change flight from 16th to the 10th Jan. Rang the reservations service centre. Yes could do. Wanted the same time of 2.55pm which gets to Auckland at 7.30 pm cost $205 extra for flight fare difference. Sucked it up and okayed it. Couldn't get me on that flight, so got me on later flight at 7.30pm - gets into Auck 12.30am. Agreed, the cost came down to $20. An hour on the phone and happy with the service and new flight. Got to select seat in manage my booking and selected row 6 from original row 17, both ailse seats. Thanks Qantas, a happy customer.",January 2024,4,4,1,5,5,4,5,3
1,Money Grabbing hide behind internet and phone and ignore you because it it easier so you can go away,"1. I booked an earlier flight which cost me $300 more so I could be in Perth at a certain time
2. Qantas was aware of my Food allergies
3. My flight was cancelled through no fault of my own
4. Being a small airport, I really had no option but to get on that flight!
5. When it came to fly from Coffs Harbour you contacted the wrong person, and I was not contacted till I go to the airport
6. Upon arriving at the airport they advised me that my flight was cancelled and a refund may be in order and to contact reservations
7. We contacted reservations /Cancellations/refund head office
8. Asked about my Meal on the way back to Perth they said it would be organised with no issues
9. I had to wait hours!!!!
10. Got to Melbourne and boarded the Flight hours behind schedule
11. When everybody got a meal no gluten-free meal
So here is the Dilemma
I paid $300 more for a flight which was cancelled
Placed on the flight which was $300 cheaper which I could have had
Then to add salt to the wound Qantas with all the time in the world could not even get my meal Correct
and after 4 months they won't answer any emails to solve the issue, tried calling and Wait time well lets say its a wait and hold time .....same thing",November 2023,2,2,2,1,2,2,3,1
2,Poor Food - nice staff - poor lounge in Bangkok,"The trip started poorly at Bangkok with the check-in staff barely speaking English
Qantas uses the Miracle lounge who’s food is dreadful. The plane was a bit dated however the entertainment system was good, the headphones could have been better. The big let down was the food - the appetiser was a small spring roll which was dry. My main course was beef curry which turned up as a lump of cow on rice. The beef was tender but tasteless. The veg offering was a hard green stick of something. The cheese plate to follow was a few bits of cheese couple of grapes and half of dried apricot. No crackers or butter.
The staff were helpful and almost apologetic for the food they served.",December 2023,3,3,4,5,2,4,2,1
1,Worst customer experience,"-- Our flight from Canberra To Sydney was cancelled the previous night of travel at 8:00pm.
-- This resulted in Qantas changing our flights from Canberra- Syd-Blr(Qantas) to Canberra - Syd-KL-Blr(Malaysian airlines)
--The dietary requirements mentioned in Qantas booking were not updated to Malaysian airlines. As a result, we had to eat what is available
--We paid a huge price to travel via Qantas. But, Qantas put us on to Malaysian Airlines. The difference in the cost is easily AUD 1500 to 2000. What is the point in paying for Qantas and flying Malaysian airlines? I strongly advise Qantas to refund the difference in the price
--Also, while travelling from BLR to SYD, the entire entertainment system was down. None of the passengers were able to view it. It's hard to understand how Qantas cannot check this in advance.
-- The disgusting part is, the call centre in Qantas India is good for nothing. You dial the number and select the option in the IVR. After a few minutes, it automatically disconnects. Also, the change option and the cancel/voucher option is disabled in the application. So, how do expect a passenger to make the changes?

It's high time, Qantas needs to work on the customer experience.

Overall, this time it was a bad experience flying Qantas.",November 2023,3,3,1,2,2,4,4,4
3,"Ok, got us there!","We arrived which was the main thing, and they provided a meal which was quite nice and drinks. The staff were nice too. BUT everytime we fly out of Queenstown on Qantas lately, its late or delayed which would be ok if they updated anyone. We dont get alerts on our phones, updates to the ""on-time"" status, no signage updates at the gate. So you arrive early as requested, then you sit in this boarding area thats small with barely any food, and you have no idea when you actually board. No one tells you anything. This trip, I got updated that it was delayed by an hour only once we had already boarded. Needs to be better.

The headsets provided too are very sore on your ears but hard to complain to much when free I guess.",January 2024,1,3,4,4,3,3,1,3
1,Avoid the direct flight from Heathrow to Perth. Large number of Economy Seats are not working properly.,"I booked this flight months ago and paid to reserve a seat. I booked 41D but when I tried to check-in online, I wasn’t able to get an e-boarding pass.
Attended the desk at LHR & tried to get boarding pass but the check-in staff were confused as to why my boarding pass wouldn’t print. Eventually they over rode the system & printed it off.

Once on the plane, it became obvious why.

There was no power in the seat at all. I spoke to the cabin crew and they told me the seat should never have been allocated as it was decommissioned. A 16.5 hour flight with no entertainment and no USB port to charge anything.
The passenger in front of me was told her seat had no audio so she would have to share the headphone port with her neighbour.
I got moved to 47C.
This was great until I tried to use the tray table. It was broken and taped up to the seat in front. I ate my meals from a pillow and magazine balanced on my lap. Again, the cabin crew said the only reason it was empty was because it was also decommissioned due to the broken table.

I spoke to the cabin crew and one of them told me that about 30 seats were defective and that if he could “magic” me a working tray table he would.
I walked around the cabin a few times and several screens were clearly not working and I wasn’t the only one eating from my lap.
One passenger got moved into my initial seat because her initial one was so badly broken that she opted to sit somewhere with no entertainment/ power.

I used to love Qantas. I used to think they were the best airline in the world but the Dreamliners are looking and feeling tired.
I paid £1800 for this flight and the standard of facilities and quality of service was no better than a budget airline.
To keep selling seats that are not fit for purpose is outrageous and bordering on fraud. There’s no way they all just broke at once.
Really really poor.",January 2024,4,1,1,2,1,2,2,3
4,Smooth flight,"I booked on this flight several months before, as I was planning to spend my time with my friends in MEL over the Christmas holiday. On 23rd December checkin was not crowded at that time and the complementary access to the Qantas club in Adelaide was good as usual. The short 70 minutes flight to Melbourne was rather smooth compared to the previous bumpy rides. The service was good. To my surprise, platinum members were asked to choose from the menu before it began to serve everyone in the Business class. As there were only 12 seats, it was rather in a hurry always during this flight.",December 2023,-1,5,4,5,5,5,5,4
1,Delayed for 9 hours without prior notice!!!,"Their service is declining, My flight route was Auckland to Spore with a layover in Brisbane for 2 hours (originally) but my flight was delayed for 9 hours!!! so i had to stay in Brisbane airport for 9 hours, Brisbane airport is not Changi airport spore where you can easily kill time, there's not much to do there. What made me disappointed the most was there was no prior communication about the delay, they just informed me when i was about to check in. I understand that oftentimes delay is necessary due to technical issues to get fixed before the aircraft fly away. But, prior communication of delay is not an exception in my opinion, Luckily i had no connecting flight from spore, what if I had to fly somewhere else from spore, i would have missed the flight. Also, Brisbane airport has the worst customer service desk, the desk is unmanned most of the times.",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

This airline is arrogant, has the worst customer service and charges as if they are a top airline. Their executives rip off their staff and customers. They don’t care about anyone or anything other than themselves and their bonuses. Spend the little extra money and fly with someone else.

The staff were so friendly and helpful , they kept checking in to see if I was okay & kept saying that I was doing a great job . That made me feel better & also less stressful . Thank you QF3 for your amazing service , I look forward to flying with you all in the future .",January 2024,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
2,Sad to See This Airline Operating in Such a Manner.,"I know that 'Qantas Bashing' is all the rage at the moment, but really our flight experience could be termed 'average' at best. This is not a full-service airline displaying a high level of customer service.

Check-in was a slow and painful experience. We couldn't help but notice that one of the check-in agents was on her phone updating her 'Facebook Account'. Surely, paying customers come first. I don't blame the employee- instead there is obviously a lack of managerial oversight.

The flight left and arrived on-time, but the on-board experience was (in a number of ways) unpleasant. Passengers aboard this A330-200 were packed in like sardines. My 5'11"" frame was not made for these seats. Inflight entertainment was displayed on an old screen and operated in a clunky manner. Whilst the flight attendants used manners with us, we witnessed and heard them being rude to other passengers. The food was terrible and really Qantas if you are not going to offer decent food (breakfast was a mini-muffin and a half a glass of orange juice) I'd rather you simply didn't serve any. Toilets were clean and serviced regularly. In fact, the cabin was clean- a surprise for a 20 year old aircraft.

I see little evidence of the supposed 'turn-around' in levels of service that Qantas is claiming to be working on. Flying economy (particularly on a red-eye flight) is never going to an easy experience, but there is no excuse for a full service airline not engaging with customers in a professional and civil manner.",January 2024,1,2,2,1,2,3,2,1

5,Good flight,"Good flight - check in was smooth and very fast. Flight boarding was also very smooth with limited waiting. Flight was on time. On the plane, seats were quite comfortable and a pillow and blanket along with an amenity pack was provided. Seatback entertainment was good - wide variety of viewing options. the ""sling"" on the back of the seat for your legs was surprisingly comfortable and better than just having your legs down. Meals were also fine, the beef option for dinner was nice and well flavoured, I had the fruit option for breakfast which was also fresh. The snacks during the night were also good - cookies, Tim Tams, ham and cheese toasties and an Icecream. Bathrooms were kept clean. Landing was on time and staff were friendly.",June 2023,5,4,4,5,3,5,5,4

1,No food for over 24 hours,"We were excited that Qantas’ website says plant-based meals are now available on all flights and in all classes as vegan meals (which we usually pre-order) are often spicy which can cause me migraines. However, on a 13-hour flight from London to Singapore, they said there weren’t any left as only a small amount is on each flight, and said that no other food was available (vegetarian or snacks or even bread!). After pleading with them, they eventually gave us tomato soup (from Business) that was hard to eat with flat bamboo spoons. The staff weren’t helpful or sympathetic at all. We were very hungry by the time we arrived in Singapore but there was no time to get any food there. When we boarded the flight to Melbourne, we asked the flight attendants if they could ensure we got plant-base meals, explaining we hadn’t had any food. However, they were rude and unhelpful. When we explained what the website said, one attendant said rudely, “Well, why didn’t you click on it?” (making no sense). They said there were plant-based meals on board but wouldn’t reserve any for us. We waited several hours to see if we were going to get any food. We did get the meals but by this time we hadn’t eaten for over a day. The plane on the second leg was a (substituted) domestic plane with no entertainment so we just had to sit there for 9 hours. The whole trip was a nightmare and very distressing. I complained to Qantas but all they said was to reserve special meals in future. We’ve flown with Qantas for decades but will never again.

5,A Journey Beyond Excellence,"Dear Qantas team,
I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for the exceptional experience on QF2 from Heathrow to Singapore. The staff at Heathrow Terminal 3 were incredibly helpful and professional, exemplifying high-end customer service.
The journey was made even more magical by the attentive service, luxurious amenities, heavenly food, and wine, as well as the comfortable beds provided by the Qantas team. Special thanks to the lovely Cynthia & Philip, and their peers who went above and beyond.
A shoutout to the flight attendant who escorted us during boarding – a thoughtful touch that added to the overall experience. Witnessing the care provided to a family with an unwell child was commendable and made us proud to be Qantas passengers.
Having flown all levels, from economy to various classes, We can confidently say that Qantas consistently delivers exceptional service.",January 2024,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
2,You have to fight with the agent to pay the advertised price,Qantas tried to add additional charges over the phone despite not being in terms and conditions. Lodged this with the ACCC but they have to be the most dormant regulator in the world. They were once a great airline with great great service but now a dodgy airline with inconsistent service and dishonest agents.,December 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Never fly Quantas,"We chose Quantas believing it was going to be a good experience.
We were extremely disappointed.
Our flight from NZ was delayed leaving us no time for our connecting flight, everything was a absolute rush and luggage didn't arrive at our destination till the following evening.
Luggage had medical aids in it.
When we boarded our flight home the plane hadn't been cleaned, our flight from Brisbane was again delayed and the plane was so cramped that we struggled to eat our meal comfortably.
We will never fly Quantas again. it was such a traumatic experience for me and impacted hugely on my mental health.

1,Worst airline ever,"(1) Flight delayed. Cannot start one of the engines. That got me worried if it is even safe to fly with Qantas.
(2) Cannot direct check-in luggage to destination on return flight back to Australia. Have to collect and re-check in luggage at transit. Incorrect advice by the consultant when re-booking the flight as I specifically asked to confirm that the luggage can be checked in through to destination.
(3) Luggage was transported on different flight back to Melbourne. Waited / wasted over an hour at luggage collection as there was no prior communication.
(4) Food tasted below average.
(5) Unfair treatment by crew. Other passengers can recline their chair but not me.

All of the above happened in one trip and the only reason I decided to fly with Qantas is the airline ratings. Apparently the rating does not reflect the service itself.",December 2023,1,2,2,2,1,3,1,1

5,Qantas a330-300 Economy Review,"I flew with Qantas Airlines back in January this year. Although there was a 45 minute delay, it was a pleasant and comfortable journey.

My seat was 31a, a window seat in the middle cabin of the economy class cabin. The seat was decently comfortable, with a large IFE screen, tray table and many storage pockets to put your belongings. The seat had descent legroom and came with a netted footrest.

The food was descently good. The first service was drinks, and there were a descently good option of alcoholic beverages and non-alcoholic beverages. The first meal service consisted of yakisoba, wagyu beef and a vegetable pasta. I chose the yakisoba and it came with a focaccia and a drink. The second meal service consisted of fried rice or a ratatouille. I opted for the fried rice and it tasted really good. Betweent the first and second meal service, the cabin crew went around the cabin handing out snaks such as chips, and there was also a self-service bar which had drinks and some snacks.

The service on this flight was excellent. Thr cabin crew were really attentive and friendly. They went around the cabin multiple times checking if everyone is ok.

Overall this was a really good flight, and although there was a 45 minute delay, I would definitely use Qantas again.",January 2024,3,5,5,5,4,4,4,5

I tried to buy another flight to spend less than 8 hours in Sydney so as not to require a visa. But the Qantas Chile employees did not help me. They only gave me one number that didn't work!!! , then they gave me another one that I never had a response!!!!. At the airport hours before my flight, I had to cancel my flight. I was crying and asked them to sell me a ticket or help me communicate to change the day or time. Nobody helped. Nobody. I felt very humiliated and confused. They only gave me a number that didn't work and another that no one answered. How is it possible that they leave a passenger without help. It has been my worst experience at the airport. Qantas is not responding or helping. Furthermore, I never received an email notifying me of my cancellation, the flight reservation simply disappeared. I still trying call Qantas and no one answers.",January 2024,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Being one of the first off the plane helped getting quickly through immigration. A bit of a splurge for BC but nice as a holiday treat!",December 2023,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5
1,Not a great experience,"Unfortunately Qantas really seem like they've dropped the ball with service and reliability. We travelled to LAX in December 2023 and paid 4 x what we would have paid for flights pre-Covid. The flight over was okay and the food was also okay, not great. On the way back to Brisbane our direct flight was cancelled a few days before departing and we were put on a flight via Sydney. On the international leg to Sydney my 11 year old daughter started throwing up so we asked if we could get a can of lemonade to settle her stomach and the flight attendant advised that she would come back with it once the seatbelt signs were turned off which was fine. But she never came back. Unfortunately the timeline once we got to Sydney was very tight due to having to pick up bags from international and recheck them in at domestic and we ended up having to run for our flight to BNE along with a busload of other passengers. Then on the SYD-BNE leg they seated my 11 year old daughter seperately to the rest of us which wasn't ideal, especially because she was throwing up. Also flying on Xmas day really didn't feel any different to any other day, whereas when we fly on Xmas day with Air NZ there are a few extra treats for the kids etc. Overall not a great experience and we will look at other airlines for our next overseas trip",December 2023,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,2
1,Delays Quaranteed!,Delay added up to 2 hours on the international leg which meant we missed our local connection to Melbourne without any effort by Qantas Ground staff in Syd to expediate our connections.

5,Special NYE In The Air,"A heartfelt thank you to the exceptional team on Qantas Flight QF1, especially during the New Year's Eve 2023 journey from Sydney to London via Singapore. Having traveled with Qantas over the years, we've experienced their stellar service across all classes – from economy to the recent luxurious experience in first class.
Celebrating New Year's Eve in first class was nothing short of magical. We actually had 3 new years to celebrate for Sydney, Singapore and London! The outstanding customer service from the Qantas lounges in Sydney and Singapore, coupled with the warm, friendly, and beyond accommodating staff, set the tone for an unforgettable experience.
The entire staff, particularly on that special New Year's Eve, went above and beyond. Kudos to the business class team for their friendliness and willingness to make every moment special, including taking selfies for passengers. In first class, Cynthia and her peers stood out, making us feel incredibly welcome. The service, menu, and comfort surpassed all expectations, making it difficult to disembark as we didn’t want to leave.
Cynthia's exceptional care towards passengers, coupled with the team's hard work and commitment to ensuring every passenger's needs and concerns are met with a genuine smile, truly make Qantas Flight QF1 a stellar experience. Thank you for creating lasting memories of a special NYE in the air!",December 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

2,Bad Auckland Ground Support,The flight and the on air staffs were good. However Auckland ground staff support was very bad. Very very unorganised. More than half the passengers will not be able to check in online or via the kiosk they have since its international flight. Those who cant check in will be directed to Support counter. Problem is they only had one support counter open and ended up with a long queue. There were 4 to 5 other staffs who were there just to tell customers which check in kiosk was available for use. This is something that could have been handled by 1 or 2 staffs at the most and the rest could have been helping with Support counter. Took us close to 2 hours just to get checkin done and we had to rush for boarding. Really bad experience.,January 2024,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,5
1,Do not use Qantas.,"Qantas does not have their representatives in American Airports, so they delegate their American part of the journey to the American Airlines. If there is any problem with the booking - you are on your own. We had a problem at Reagan Airport to fly the first leg to Dallas, TX. There was a problem with the booking. Something went wrong and the tickets we got from Qantas were showing our trip, but American Airlines couldn't see the trip - just the ticket numbers. AA told us to talk to Qantas, Qantas told us everything is good on their side and we should talk to AA. As a result we couldn't fly. My recommendation is: DO not use Qantas on USA flights.",December 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas never fail to betray your trust,"I fly alot, but I’m a nervous flyer. So I make my airline choices on safety. Qantas may be safe but they are an utter disaster.
I flew from Dallas to Melbourne and arrived to collect my baggage at the carousel - but no baggage.
I reported to the lost baggage desk and the guy working it was on his mobile and could not have cared less. He asked me details of the bag and my address etc. and gave me a card with my file number and a phone number to call.
When I called the number the following day it was the Qantas main switch board. No one had a clue and I eventually ended up talking to some poor kid in the Phillipines who had no information or access to any.
He did give me a website. The website asked me for my file number etc.
When I accessed my information it told me they had found my bag and it had arrived from Singapore on the 25th December. I didn’t leave Dallas until the 31st of December. My address was wrong, the bag description was wrong and it said on the phone number - not to be contacted.
No one to ask. No one to call. No one at Qantas cares or feels any need to provide you with service once you have given them your money.
Their aim is to maximise their profit and minimise service expenditure.
Use Qantas at your peril. There is no more humanity or client focus at Qantas. Staff are demoralised, jaded and abused after years of exploitation by Alan Joyce and the board.
A really horrific experience.",December 2023,2,2,1,5,1,3,1,1
5,Excellent Christmas service,"Cannot praise Qantas staff enough, with flights Adelaide return Melbourne. Checkin was smooth, staff helpful with requests for priority line up. Plane was punctual and baggage not lost. At a time when Qantas has negativity with service, I found that the ground and plane staff extremely efficient",December 2023,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,3
4,Holiday time to Tasmania,"This flight was delayed due to a storm in Sydney but after that everything went smoothly and we seemed to pick up time. The crew were good although the person announcing needed to speak a little louder as he was hard to hear
The seats were comfy for the 1.5hour flight",December 2023,4,3,1,4,3,4,4,2
2,I was back on Qantas.,"I have not flown with Qantas for many years. I was at one time a top-tier frequent flyer with Qantas and would go out of my way and pay a premium to fly with them. I have travelled in all classes with Qantas internationally over the years. However, I stopped flying with Qantas about 12 years ago because of degraded service levels delivered by rude arrogant crews. However, I needed to be in Bali for a couple of days recently and Qantas was the most suitable flight option with their A330-300 aircraft. Check-in and onboarding were not a problem. When I arrived at my economy seat, the meal tray was taped into the closed position with some stickers from the galley. I brought this to the attention of the crew. They seemed embarrassed and tried to seat me elsewhere but I was informed it was a full flight. Therefore, I had to eat my meal on a broken meal tray or my lap. This is a 6-hour flight. Not a good reintroduction to Qantas. The flight manager recorded my details and offered a $50 hotel voucher and told me it would arrive by email in a few days. I had low expectations of ever receiving the voucher. It has never arrived. Qantas are troubled airline and I will be staying clear of them in future. BTW, if Qantas are interested I am sure they can find me.",December 2023,3,1,3,3,1,2,4,1
1,Not family friendly fly REX instead,"Our daughter in law flew with a baby and toddler and treated terribly, by inconsiderate staff who couldn’t care less, she was unable to take double stroller to gate like the service REX provides and they stood and watched without offering assistance making her pull apart the pram whilst juggling a baby and toddler. Staff had the same attitude when she flew home to Melbourne from Sydney. Parents recommend you fly REX who know how to care for families allowing them to board first and take prams to gate and staff care.",November 2023,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,1
4,Positive Experience With Qantas,"While we had not planned on flying with Qantas on our flight from Dallas to Sydney, American Airlines cancelled our flight and we were fortunately rebooked on Qantas. Our cancelled American flight was business class, while the best we could get on Qantas was premium economy. We found the flight attendants to be courteous, friendly and certainly helpful. While we were not in the Qantas frequent flyer program, they made us feel welcomed and appreciated. Even though there were available seats in the business class section of the plane we couldn't upgrade thus the four vs five star rating.

Obviously, Qantas has its share of complaints concerning cancelled flights and delays, but for me if I have a choice between Qantas and American its an easy decision.",October 2023,4,4,5,5,-1,4,-1,5

1,QANTAS PATHETIC - MOVE TO VIRGIN,"HONESTLY - any bus class flyers or folks from the US - DO NOT book with Qantas. Go with virgin.

I changed my flight from CFS-MEL online and was presented a “business class” option (toggle button for those who understand tech). I selected this. It was for $900 in total purchase price for the ticket. I paid the difference. I witnessed the confirmation page stating receipt of business class fare for my return flight from Coffs Harbour to Melbourne on Wednesday, 27 December departing at 12:15pm for $726. After returning to the app I noticed it said “economy”.

I called Qantas at 9:50am and spoke to Ginny. I apologise and it hurts me to complaint about someone’s work ethic and / or customer service. She was useless. This representative either needs to be put on a performance program, or let go. I spoke to Ginny’s supervisor, Ange, who appeared helpful, yet failed to deliver on her word. She said she would call me back after she had in fact confirmed I booked a bus class fare ticket. She never called me back.

EY, will discontinue to support Qantas going forward. Here are the reasons why:

1) You've false advertised business class fares when the aircraft doesn’t accomodate business class.
2) You refuse to refund someone when they’ve bought said business fare and spend hours of your employees time refuting the fact that it was not a business class fare.
3) You degrade females in the lounge for wearing holiday attire including a Camilla dress, louboutin sandals, even when they’ve paid a business class fare 3X more than the others.
4) Your company is toxic, your new C-suite better make changes for customer
5) Personally, I’m overweight and always book business class, and your lounge desks have fat shamed me for wearing Camilla dresses and Givenchy hoodies. They’ve even refused me entrance for a 3.5k AUD bus ticket I paid to Hamilton Island from Melbourne.

The public need to know about this discrimination, bullying, monopolistic greed and unethical consumer standards Qantas has.

Word to the new CEO: learn how to adapt. Adopt delta.",November 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Qantas reschedules a 9yo UM onto a midnight flight.,"I booked my 9 yo grandson to fly as an Unaccompanied Minor, over to visit. I had booked about 11 weeks ahead.
Early in the day of the flight, I drove 4 h to Sydney to pick him up.
His father was preparing to leave to drive him 2 h to Perth to catch the plane when he received a message that he had been rescheduled onto a different flight, they had moved him to the overnight flight departing around midnight.
It is ridiculous to expect a 9 yo unaccompanied minor to catch a midnight flight and his father could not drive 2h up and 2h back at that time as he would not be able to work the next day.
We had to cancel that rescheduled flight and as I had nowhere to stay in Sydney, I had to drive 4h back down the coast.",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1
1,Distrustful airline,Airline cancelled last second from syd to yvr and was given notice of refund for hotel and food but not honored. Disgraceful and fraudulent claims.

2,Heavy need of some maintenance.,"Flight started great with 4 hour delay.
To bad Qantas does not have planes on reserve in case inbound planes are delayed.
Seats need desperately some maintenance.
Padding all worn down, feels like sitting on wood.
USB charger only working when holding it.
Knob for the food tray was broken and sharp AF.
Plus side.
Respect for the staff handling drunk passengers.
Food was great and enough time crew come by to over beverages.",November 2023,3,1,3,4,3,1,4,4
1,Poor service,"Had to fly to Adelaide for a funeral,From the moment we walked into the airport we found the staff what there was of them disinterested to assist us and rude.We booked a flight that was supposed to have movies ,internet .Got on the plane and nothing that we had paid extra for our plane had been swapped .Not even a Sorry,Our seats were dirty food crumbs and Lolly papers .I unfortunately had to visit the toilet OMG the floor was not just wet with urine and stunk it was literally swimming in it.Absolutely disgusting.Will never fly with Quanta’s again.",November 2023,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5,Great Flight Back Home,"The flight back home from Hamilton Island was also excellent, and again the way we were looked after by the cabin crew, led by Fiona, was excellent. Thank you.",December 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
2,Was not impressed at all.,"The 737 800 is too small for a 6-hour flight. It is not comfortable for this amount of time and the toilets seemed to block or over fill. It brings down the Qantas name to cram the aircraft with this number of passengers using 30 rows. At least they should remove a couple of rows of seating to increase leg room. The seats are not wide enough as well. degrading flight. Charge a little more and provide a service that is expected from Qantas that is not a budget service. Qantas you are bringing your brand down!
Pleas note that if i had to fly with then i would but its not what i expected from Qantas. I have booke a wide bodied ailinere for my next Bali flight.",November 2023,1,1,4,2,2,4,5,3

2,Racial discrimination from Check in staff,"My Jestart flight got cancelled and we got rescheduled to take qantas. The staff Elloise was serving us on 10 Dec at Hobart. She was rude and unfriendly to cut off my question when I wanted to ask something. Minimal eye contact was given to us when she served us. I asked my question early as I did not want her to relook into the seats if she was already on the screen. Thus I asked early only to be cut off by her saying not now. As she was dealing with my seats, I requested for front rows of it’s possible. She gave us the worst seats (behind the toilet door) and we’re were the first in queue of the economy class to checked in. On the system, we did see other available seats. Not only did she just gave us a lousy seats, she did not even inform us and was just rushing to serve us and end the service. Especially when the staff knew we were from a rescheduled flight from Jetstar, their faces expression changed to a smiley polite face to an annoyed and look down face as though we were not worthy to be served. I’m disappointed as I saw her handling other customers with a much more warm look than us. I feel being racially disrespected as she served us and also giving us such a seat allocation. Usually airline staff will be very polite to inform us the seats they allocated and asked if that’s fine. But this lady was just in a hurry to serve us and because I requested to sit tgt, I think she got annoyed and gave us bad seats for a long haul 8h20min flight.

In addition, My friend’s luggage was 26kg and she requested for the staff Elloise to paste a fragile sticker on her luggage. However, she did not do so and commented that “your luggage is so heavy that they won’t be able to throw it around”. Thus she went on to place the heavy tag and no fragile sticker.

My ratings is for the treatment the front counter Qantas towards us, As well as the feedback team. I wrote 2 official feedback but no reply from them. To note, In flight service was great.",December 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Smack on the face for loyalty,"My husband is a gold lifetime member of Qantas. Member since 1997. Been a platinum member.
Went to Business Class Lounge, as usual, only to be told by a rude Qantas staff member wearing a silly Santa’s hat that my 2 daughters could not accompany us into the lounge. For decades gold class members came bring their families in. Suddenly now a change. Said it was policy. Unless it has changed recently & communicated deep in small print, this has never been their policy & not a wise way to reward loyalty. Said it was because girls were over 17. We have flown countless times with them being over 17 & the family has been into the lounge.
It was 5:30am. Lounge was deserted. No empathy. Just blockages.
I’ve done my last Qantas flight.",November 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Terrible Service! Worst Experience. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED,"Booking reference: 65AS7J

Travelled with Qantas from Wellington to Delhi and return. On my either way, both flights were delayed.
1. Qantas ground staff as well as air crew, both were irresponsible and no empathy or courtesy for passengers.
2. Entertainment screen not working on flight, informed flight manager thrice but never got resolved throughout the journey.
3. Poor bag handling, my brand new bag was damaged.
4. Reached my final destination after 12 hours than scheduled.
5. Not a single Qantas staff contacted apologizing for the inconvenience caused.
6. Filed 3 complaints back to back asking for reimbursement for the inconvenience and damage to my bag. Case Numbers: 09834341, 09797299, 09797143. Not a single one was acknowledged.
7. Missed the pre-booked meals of the passenger. Instead of apology, air crew staff argues.

2,With today’s technology this service can be improved.,"I arrived six hours earlier and requested a flight change, despite available seats online. Despite offering to pay a change fee, they chose to depart with empty seats.

2,Avoid if you want to fly when you actually book for.......,"Good luck if you even get to take off! I will never book with Qantas again. 5 flights over 17 days and all bar one have been changed multiple times. The flight times were selected for a reason, all of which is now completely out of the window. The icing on the cake was our initial flight over to Sydney changed by 13 hours. I would never have booked this flight with young children and with only 24 hours notice, we dont have any other option but to still run with Qantas. Book with a more reliable airline would be my advice to anyone.",December 2023,3,3,4,4,3,3,3,3
1,Vintage Australia,I bought two bottles of alcohol as a present in the airport after security (like you would from duty free). This was subsequently taken off me at the boarding gate where they had another security check..?! They said no liquids over 100ml allowed. I had to throw away two bottles. Bizarre. No idea how they are able to do this. Almost feels like a scam buying things from the airport. Very Australian creating extra rules for themselves.,December 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Massive fail,"Absolute greediness. Was Perth bound for my own 50th birthday and had booked myself and my pet to fly on 1st sept for an 8th Dec departure.
Plane wasn’t compatible with my pet but they
Accepted the booking and money anyways. I found out after I dropped my pet off and was in the queue to check-in personally.
I’m saddened for the people - ground staff here in broome and in Sydney that had to deal with the absolute incompetence of a greedy conglomerate like Qantas. I missed my own party Qantas. Thanks heaps for that . What spirit of Australia is that? U deserve to fail. Had to pay for the extra too as I booked that long ago and used points but they wouldn’t bump as cover the cost.
Shame on you Qantas. Nothing has changed only staff working harder. Massive fail

1,Rude Crew Staff,"We have have booked Qantas flight QF38 on 8 Dec departing at 11:40pm from Singapore to Melbourne on 8 Dec with my husband and my 4 yesr old daughter. I always thought Qantas was a chlld/family oriented international carrier but to my dismay, it was not the case. I understand it is a red eye flight and passengers are trying to sleep. My daughter was cranky as and when throughout the flight but definitely not non stop crying. Children sometimes will be cranky or whiny but i feel as a parent if we did coax or carry them in our arms shows that we are trying our best in that situation. It was not as though we let our 4 year old daughter cry non stop and doing nothing. It was just unfortunate that my daughter the only cranky kid on the flight. I have seen many times other parents carrying their cranky kid in their arms but never did once the air crew staff ask the parent to go somewhere else. One of the flight steward, Towie actually signal my husband who was carrying my 4 year daughter to the back of the airplane. I have travelled on Qantas multiple times this year with my 4 year old daughter but none of the air crew was this rude. I am utterly disappointed in Qantas with your air crew staff who has no empathy with family with young children furthermore i am a 4 months pregnant mother.",November 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,An absolute joke - never again,"After spending 5 hours at the airport waiting for a delayed flight. The flight never showed up and the flight was cancelled. We then got sent to a 2 star hotel which looked like a detention centre. I have submitted a request for a reimbursement for the money I spent on the hotel I never got to stay in, in Melbourne .. the hire car I never got to drive in Melbourne. The hotel I had to pay to stay in at Coffs Harbour. A total of $550. It’s been 10 days and have not had a response. I called the customer service call centre to get an update on my case and they said they are still dealing with cases like mine from months ago and that they couldn’t tell me when a customer service agent will be able to call me back about my case.

This is the 3rd delayed flight I’ve taken with Qantas in 10 days! Engineering problems every time .. thinks it’s time to hire some new engineers.

WILL BE FLYING WITH VIRGIN AIRWAYS FROM NOW ON.

1,Disappoing meal sevice Qantas - QF 198 - Apia to Brisbane - business class,"Our flight left 7.14am on time from Apia so getting up at 4.00am , of course no breakfast at hotel. Sitting upfront, we were looking forward to breakfast. What did we get ? Toast but no butter, nor any spread, one pack cookies, one muffin and a cereal and milk. That's it. Upon asking if we could have some butter and jam, crew advised that catering was done in Sydney and thats is all they have. Just dry bread!.
Could it be that QF is biased against Samoans and could not care less what quality of food they serve and save on catering costs. It looks that way. High carb diet, very unhealthy food. A big health concern and disappointment in QF catering selection. One would think if catering originates in Brisbane, one would get a decent breakfast.

They finally located the payment 2 hrs later after constant arguing, but instead of using those funds, I had to pay again and wait for a refund. I was told up to 7 days but when nothing was received I followed up and was told 21 to 28 days.

However we are pleased to say that the A380 facilities were good, seats comfortable, blankets excellent, service and friendliness of staff were very good.
Food was acceptable with a good range of drinks and helpful staff during the ""shut-down"" period. Appreciated the ""nibbles"" of fruit, chocolate, crisps etc available in the general area whilst tea and coffee was provided upon request without a grump (Can't say that for some of the other airlines).
All in all a good experience so well done Qantas.",November 2023,4,4,3,5,4,5,5,4
2,Late as usual,"As usual, we were late. Rolling delay that meant we got into Sydney well over an hour late. The bags took ages to come off in SYD and they had 4 flights all being offloaded on one carousel (all others empty!). The snack was dreadful - three individually packed items with paper and plastic wrapping, then all wrapped in a box. Come on - so wasteful!",December 2023,3,3,4,2,2,2,1,2
3,Stay clear of Qantas,"After paying full fare for 2 adults and 1 child (11 yo) I had expected great service from Qantas as their reputation was high pre-covid.

Out first leg (Akld-Syd) was horrendous. Yes we were in economy but even my knees touched the seat in front (I'm only 165 cm). The second leg (Syd-Singapore) was fabulous but was serviced by Finnair. Superb service here. Then our final leg (Akld-Phuket) service by Jetstar allowed for no seat selection in advance which meant we were seated separately and my 11yo daughter sitting next to strangers!!! Thankfully the strangers were kind enough to offer me their seat as they could see how distraught she was.

Add in my husband wasn't offered food or drink on Jetstar, lost luggage (2 bags going to Phuket and 1 bag returning to Akld), my husband having coffee spilt on him by a flight attendant (who shrugged it off and gave him a bunch of tissues.... no apology, and burnt husband) .... I would stay well clear of Qantas in the future.",November 2023,2,2,3,2,1,2,2,1

Second, toilets were not running properly and as a result, they did not give passengers the proper meal because we might overwhelmed the toilet. Announcements were made late.

2,Has Qantas become a budget airline?,"QF43 departed Sydney a bit late at 1645 but arrived a tad early.

Our evening meals were a choice between spicy beef noodles, chicken salad and a vegetarian lentil shepherd pie. The spicy beef noodles looked like sludge and was not the best. All meals were served in a box, with a small piece of warm focaccia on a napkin. And that was it. Much later on, a Splice ice cream was handed out as dessert. Much more later on, the tea and coffee were served. You could help yourself to water at the water dispenser with very tiny cups. Best to bring your own water bottle to fill up.

It was soon lights out. Whilst the lights were out, cups of water and a small packet of soy crisps came by. Most people were asleep and literally in the dark so this service went unnoticed.

Instead of back seat screens, tablets were supplied but there was insufficient quantity for all passengers. If you were not using it for any period of time, the flight attendant asked for it back.

When we were preparing to land, request for the tablets to be removed from the back of the seats. Before I had the chance to do it, a flight attendant roughly pulled mine out of its position and thrust it into the back pocket. Surprisingly she did not do it to 2 other persons sitting close by.

So might as well fly Jetstar.",November 2023,3,3,1,1,1,3,2,1
1,Worst customer service ever,Worst customer service ever. After a long delay boarding we were told that as we were running so late we would not be able to land in Newcastle as they were doing scheduled night works on the runway. We were unloaded off the flight and told by ground staff that they would book us a hotel room or to speed things up (it was already late at night) we could book our own hotel and we would be reimbursed up to $200 for a hotel room. I took this option in good faith but when I later put in a claim for reimbursement of my accommodation I got a reply email saying that the cancelled flight wasn’t the fault of qantas and therefore they wouldn’t be refunding my room. I responded to email saying that was a mistake and it was the fault of qantas as our flight was significantly delayed which was the reason we couldn’t land at our destination. It has now been three weeks and I have emailed eight times for a response and have heard absolutely nothing. When I have tried ringing I have been told that they only deal with complaints through emails (how convenient that they can then just totally ignore them ). I definitely won’t be flying qantas again and will be taking this matter further.,November 2023,1,1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1

1,Qantas QF 9 business class v Jetstar economy the winner is Jetstar by a mile,"You would think going business class would save you from the worst of Qantas. No it doesn't $4,000 for two tickets later we can say Qantas treats everyone badly. QF 9 business class was terrible.

The international business class lounge in Melbourne is a windowless soulless place that wouldn't look out of place in a cyclone shelter. The offerings were minimal,the place was packed.

Boarded eventually close to time but of course sat on the tarmac for 25 minutes .""Last minute paperwork"" apparently

Took off for the 3 hour flight. Didnt see one cabin staff for 1 hour 45 minutes . I timed them. Not one drink even offer of one . It seems the call bell doesnt work either despite the light going on Nobody answered the call button

Finally some of the so called meal arrived in business class. I glanced behind and all of premium economy were served. Then the cabin staff disappeared to chat in the galley. No service. The last two items of the menu just failed to arrive but i was reassured by over hearing, the cabin staff had plans to go out together that night.

Partner requested a gluten free meal well in advance. When it finally appeared it was inedible

So yes Virginia, Qantas treats everyone, business class and economy, the same, badly. Do not pay for business class on QF 9. It makes Jetstar look like fine dining.

To be positive the seat was comfy",November 2023,4,5,5,2,1,4,4,1
3,Fright or Flight - Bad Experience on Qantas Flight,"I paid an extra $15.00 to sit in an Exit seat to get more leg room from Darwin to Perth. About an hour and a half into the flight a man in the window seat in front of me threw up all over the floor and back of the seat in front of him. He was also in an Exit seat. The Flight Attendant moved the passengers from that row to clean up the mess. As she was cleaning up I asked the Attendant if that particular passenger was going to be allowed to sit back there. She replied ""definitely not"". After the mess was cleaned up I couldn't believe it when the same passengers were placed back in their original seats. My biggest concern was that particular passenger being next to the window was expected to operate the Emergency Door if the plane had a crash landing. He absolutely smelled of alcohol and should not have been allowed to sit back in that seat. If it was just a normal sickness he still shouldn't have been allowed to sit there. Once he sat back in his seat he went back to sleep for the rest of the flight. I had to wake him up to tell him that we were disembarking. The brochures on the plane give you information about what is expected of you sitting in those seats. Maybe the Attendants need to read them as well.

In conclusion the flight and service were very good , but the flight was an hour late taking off. That's another story.

Shame on you Qantas",November 2023,5,5,1,5,5,3,5,5
1,It's time for the Spirit of Australia to go into the light,"Before I begin, I will note that there is good and bad in everything, and that there are very good staff working in difficult conditions. That said, if you are considering Qantas for an economy flight, I strongly suggest that you reconsider. If you are flying in business, Qantas is excellent and will take care of you. However, economy passengers are treated like cattle. I have flown around the world, numerous times and with many, many airlines. Over the last few years, Qantas economy has become deplorable. Aside from the incredibly cramped conditions, the aircraft is old, the food disgusting (see pic attached) and as a company they have absolutely no consideration for economy passengers. They offer stock standard responses, but in years, have not made a change for the better. This particular flight was jam packed because of multiple last-minute cancellations. The man sitting next to me had been travelling for over 30 hours from the US, having had multiple flights changed or cancelled. The cabin was hot, and despite the red faces of passengers and sweat pouring from our brows, the crew did nothing, and we were flying into a 40-degree day in Perth. The Qantas lounge in Melbourne was in complete disarray, with escalators broken and staff trying to cope with all the cancelled flights and confused people. Even the cleaning staff could not wait and were vacuuming into distressed people seeking information. Whenever I exit a Qantas flight in economy, my body aches from having to sit in contorted positions to fit into the seats. If you listen, you can hear other passengers complaining or in shock at the lack of space. Trying to get information about my changed flights, I called the Qantas line for frequent flyers and encountered incredibly rude and unhelpful staff. This was once a great airline, and it is a shame to see that their focus is now only on business class. A test for a good comnpany is how they react when things go bad. Sadly, the reaction of Qantas is determined by the class in which you fly. My recommendation, if you’re flying in economy, look for other options.",October 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
2,"Cancelled flights, no clear compensation, booked alternative worse flights without comsultation","Return direct flight, London to Perth.
Departing flight was delayed but atleast it did depart and staff were great.
Unfortunately can't say the same about the return. Flight first delayed by 4 hours, then cancelled all together!
We paid close to £1,900 each for a flight and Qantas thinks booking us on a return through Singapore with a 6 hour layover and departing 7 hours earlier than scheduled is acceptable.
Customer Service number is useless as all the staff can do is search for alternative flights and book you on those. If you want to talk compensation then your told to fill out an online form that doesn't work and won't submit your complaint.
I used to love and rely on Qantas for service and predictability but sadly they are now a much worse company. I can no longer recommend and will avoid flying with them in future. I would recommend you do the same.",November 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Vegetarian people forced to remain hungry on Qantas flights, no inclusion or respect for food choices. Dont book qantas","Qantas offers Worst flights for vegetarians. Has happened multiple times they dont have food for us being vegetarian. Poor management. Dumb people sitting in their policy makers. How hard is it to put the below processes in place. 1. Meal choice to be confirm when luggage is handed so STAFF HAS ENOUGH VEGETARIAN FOOD!! 2. Ensure vegetarians are served food before serving people who can eat meat but decided to choose veg meal because their tastebuds & nose smelled something nice in a neighbour’s plate. Shameful to see in this day and age no inclusion or consideration for people who choose to NOT EAT ANIMALS.

1,Worst experience on an international flight,"Please please do not use qantas. Terrible experience that is not worth the ticket. Sat on the tarmac for 5 hours with basically no update for what was happening and only 1 bottle of small water for that 5 hours. Finally when they cancelled the flight they had no idea what to do with us or a plan in place even though they had these issues for the 5 hours. It took them over 24 hours to get us on another flight and crammed the flight to be completely full. Staff were clueless and overwhelmed.
Also no a lot of room in economy with small seats.",October 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

No travel pack, no water, no hot towel or wet wipes, no snacks. It was absolutely silent. Then pilot announced ""suppa""... Very old men struggling talking with his dentures Serving food. Uneatable. No fruits,no yoghurt. Just rice with chicken or mashed potato with pork. After passenger's fell asleep they come with tea and coffee. No drinks or snacks until breakfast. No fruits or yoghurt again. Very plain omelette. Please, bring international lines back to Brisbane and chuck the Qantas.",November 2023,2,2,2,1,1,2,4,1
3,Would I fly Qantas internationally again. Only if they smarten their act up!,"Having flown to Delhi with Qantas and returned with Singapore airlines, I would struggle to think why I would fly internationally with Qantas again.

The crew was the only positive in a list of issues, including dirty plane, tray tables that clearly were not clean and sticky from previous usage, wet toilet floors and limited options with food.

The return journey was so the opposite. The crew was just as great, but clean plane, great food, and a relaxing journey. The difference was so great, I can understand why SA is the world’s current favourite.

Come on Qantas you are letting your staff, Australia and more importantly your passengers down.",September 2023,4,3,3,5,3,1,4,1
1,Dirty plane and terrible service,"Small plane 30 people lined up for 2 toilets. Plane was filthy. Toilets were too!!!. Asked if I could have cheese and crackers as didn’t eat their meal. They didn’t have any what a joke. Payed $800 for the flight one way and used a $380 credit from covid which took 3 hours to redeem. So $1,180 for the flight. Honestly never again. They really need Qatar to be allowed to fly domestic routes. They need a fire cracker to improve their service. Hosties were rude. Was flying from South Africa, even domestic in a third world country Is better. Lift your game Qantas you used to be a good carrier",November 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1
2,Very disappointing,"Very disappointed, started with over 6 hrs in Sydney, very little information given....we were also told we had to recover our bags at Heathrow to connect with our onwards journey. all booked together......arrived in Singapore,, late...crowded into a small onwards departure hall, with no toilets etc, until plane was prepared for next part of the journey to Heathrow, we then sat for around 2 hrs on the plane ,,as the pilot sorted his notes..!!!!..( while in Singapore we asked what about our dublin flight as we had now missed the flight time...told various lines...see service desk at Singapore, when we asked getting off the plane , told no wait to Heathrow, but seems some passengers did get too go and got new arrangements,.so on the flight passengers had difference versions of the arrangements,cabin crew didn't seem to know , after a few more stories from passengers,I went up and asked and scribed on a piece of paper we had a flight booked with BA too Dublin.. ..again did we collect our bags as been told earlier at coolangatta, so we went to collect our bags..then told had gone on to Dublin....been great to have known, as we also missed the Dublin flight,rushing to get back in again....with minute's to spare, very unsettling for my wife who suffers from MS....exhausted....)..just to add for the confusion we told by a BA staff member the flight was cancelled , to be told by another it wasn't...).the airline needs to give out more correct information when things are running late .....was a very poor first time with Quantas....Ian Irvine ..Northern Ireland..",November 2023,1,3,3,1,2,4,1,4

1,Avoid at all costs,"Took 2.5 years and collective 18 hours of phone calls to get refunded on a cancelled flight (covid-related). Each agent would tell me different information (usually calling me a liar for repeating previous information, or that the previous agent was wrong), and explain that it would be 12 weeks before anything would progress. Endlessly repeating cycle. I was sworn at, hung up on three times and outright told I wouldn't get my money back on two occasions. Utterly useless company, who were determined to steal our refund away. Out of shear frustration, I wrote a negative post on their social media pages and had my refund within a week.

It's disgusting that the 'official' refund policy got me nowhere, but angry posting on facebook succeeds? If you value your money or time, book elsewhere",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas don't want to refund me back my money,"QANTAS ARE BLOODY USELESS AND WONT LISTEN OR REFUND ME BACK MY MONEY I had booked my flight with Qantas a year in advance and have now requested to cancel this booking and action a refund due to personal reasons. I contacted Qantas on 12th October 2023 and was advised that it would take 10-15 business days for the funds to be received. Nothing shows up and when I call Qantas again, they then tell me that it is the banks fault as to why I haven't received my refund so will have to wait another 7-10 business days. The required time goes past and I still have not received anything. Qantas then advised me that they need my bank details in order to refund, but why couldn't they have told me right from the beginning instead of giving me the go around!! I then sent an email providing them with the bank details as they requested the email and one whole week goes by and they said they haven't received it and so they asked me to give it to them over the phone, why couldn't they just take the details over the phone in the first place!!!! Why request something and not action it until the customer calls back! The customer service reps are rude and impatient and they're always repetitive, talks a lot of crap but nothing useful! Nearly 2 whole months requesting for a refund, is anyone at Qantas listening???? I would not recommend flying with Qantas.",October 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Business Class A Very Underwhelming Experience,"I chose Qantas to fly Business Class return to Santiago, Chile, 4 weeks ago. I was travelling on my own. The Dreamliner plane was very comfortable and I do like the larger windows. The view as we flew over the snow capped Andes mountains on the flight back to Australia was beyond breathtaking.
There was a 4 hour delay leaving Sydney but the flight departed Santiago on time.
Sadly the hospitality provided by the flight attendants on both flights was VERY underwhelming. They were not welcoming on boarding, lacked personality and made minimal effort to ensure passenger comfort. Throughout both flights they made little effort to interact and when I sought assistance to set up the flat bed I felt I was being a nuisance. During both flights I was never occasionally asked if there was anything I would like.
I needed to go to the galley on a couple of occasions just to ask for water.
In the past I have flown Business Class on Etihad, Emirates and British Airways. Those airlines make you feel you are their most important passenger on board. Qantas did not come anywhere near close and I strongly recommend to Qantas that they send all their Business Class flight attendants back to hospitality school.
The food was appalling. On reading the menu it all looks like 5* restaurant offerings. Most of what was served on my flight was a poor resemblance to how it was described in the menu. One main that I was given had baby roast potatoes as a side. They were charred black ‘golf balls’. It was an insult to Business Class passengers that food of such sub standard quality could be allowed to even be delivered to the plane, The menus are designed by Neil Perry, an esteemed Australian chef. If he had seen the presentation of the food offered on my flights he would have been devastated.
Before I book Business Class flights on Qantas again I will be reading reviews carefully and only choose this airline when there is evidence that they have successfully elevated their level of service, hospitality and food.",October 2023,5,5,2,1,2,5,4,1
1,Qantas finds another way to keep customers' money spent on flights not taken,"I had to cancel a trip from Melbourne to Perth and return for two people. The cost of the trip was $1248.60. I read the impenetrable cancellation conditions and, with trepidation and uncertainty, sought a refund online. Qantas subsequently refunded an amount of $95.72. I rang the FF line to investigate this further. I was told that if I had applied for a flight credit I'd have received credit for the full amount but as I had applied for a refund I could only expect to receive the service charges and taxes back. I asked if I could change my request from refund to flight credit and was told that Qantas would not do that. Qantas is keeping $1152.88 of my money. How is that fair?",October 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Aggressive flight attendants.,"My husband was treated well being a wheelchair user. Plane was a little run down. Only real down side was some of the flight attendants attitudes, they came across aggressive and slightly rude.",October 2023,1,1,3,1,2,3,5,2
1,Disclosure of flight credits,"It’s funny how after a senate enquire, Qantas took steps to disclose to its customers outstanding flight credits. I was one of those customers. In 2020, travel arrangements were made & with Covid, we unfortunately had to cancel our plans. In cancelling, we forfeited part of the booking which wasn’t an issue however our balance was held as a credit. Looking back through my emails & frequent flyer program no information was received on this - out of sight, out of mind - until the senate enquire. An email followed advising of the same, however the reference number given did not correspond with any bookings we had with Qantas (I was travelling weekly at the time for work (over 6 months) & had upwards of 7 bookings per month). It was a new reference & I could not clearly ascertain for which booking it pertained to. I have subsequently lodged a claim for a refund of the credit. It’s fair to say that Had these steps not been taken by the senate, Qantas would be retaining my funds. How many other customers are in my position? How much more money would Qantas have if it wasn’t for this?",November 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Qantas still overbooking flights?,"We were booked on QF702 Melb to Cairns, 1 Nov, 2023, leaving 9.45 am. We live in rural Victoria and booked a hotel on 31 Oct with breakfast included, at the airport, so that we could easily access our flight. We were at our hotel and received a call from Qantas around 7.30 to 8pm to request that we change our flight to JQ942 (Jetstar Melb to Cairns) departing 6 am.

We did not agree with this request. However, as the QF702 was overbooked, there was no choice. We were told we had to take the flight, or go much later at 7pm, as all the other people phoned had also declined the request. If we did not go on the Jetstar flight we would not be guaranteed seats on our original QF702, or one of us might go and one would not go or similar situation. QF702 the following day, 2 Nov, had no availability.

It seemed a strange situation as when we booked there were still seats available on QF702. Additionally, one of us has a visual disability and needs the other as carer whilst travelling. We also did not want to take the later 7pm flight as we were collecting a hire car at the airport and find night driving difficult.

We finally agreed to take JQ942 and demanded we be seated together with one on the aisle. We were told we would be seated separately. Eventually we managed to be seated together but at the window and middle seat. We were also told that as we had not recorded the visual disability with Qantas we could not expect special consideration regarding this particular situation.

We left the hotel at 4.30am without the breakfast we had paid for. It made for a very long day as our accommodation in Cairns was not available until 3pm (4pm Melb time). Fortunately, Bargain Car Rentals were able to give us our car at 9.30 am as compared to our booked time of 1pm.

We're not sure if there was a price differential for the tickets, this was never mentioned. However Jetstar was ok, with many more in-cabin food and drink choices, and friendly service from the crew.",November 2023,3,4,-1,5,3,5,5,5
1,Pitiful Excuse for an Airline,"Shocking service. Almost impossible to reach help lines without several hours to waste. Qantas cancelled my flight booking after advising that I needed to contact them within 24 hours to ensure the flight was not cancelled- which I did but they had already cancelled. Wasted more than 5 hours altogether on multiple phone calls. Now waiting to speak to them on another matter, second attempt having been cut off after waiting 30 minutes on hold 2 days ago. In contrast I spoke to American Airlines helpline after a 2 minute wait and the issue was sorted in less than 10 minutes. Similarly with Singapore Airlines. Qantas is an embarassment. I have been a regular leisure and business traveller with status on several airlines. I now avoid Qantas at all costs if there is any other option.",October 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

5,Great flight in premium economy,"It is nice to be giving a 5 star rating to Qantas for once. We used our points to fly from Sydney to San Francisco in premium economy. The lounge at Sydney was horrible. But the flight was great. Comfy seat, good crew overall and the food was better than domestic business class. Huge selection of movies and TV shows. Early arrival into SFO. A very good flight.",November 2023,5,5,5,4,4,5,4,5
1,Criminal credit,Had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances and claimed a credit to rebook same flight a month later. Their “credit” system is borderline criminal. Not only can I use it on whatever flight I want but I also can’t use the full amount with the added “taxes and charges”. $300 credit can’t buy the same flight as its $400 through the credit link plus $100 “transfer fee”. It’s not a transfer it’s a credit. Basically holding my money hostage whilst trying to skim more off of me. Disgusting.,November 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,"You're not learning, Qantas","My wife is currently stuck in limbo a long way from home waiting for her luggage to arrive. Her original flight was cancelled by Qantas and she was bumped to a later flight. Incredulously, three days after arriving at her destination, Qantas cannot tell my wife where her luggage is. Even more incredulously, Qantas are telling my wife they have no record of her even travelling with them - it seems the bumping to a different flight was too much for their computerised systems to accommodate. From what my wife has been explaining to me, the response from Qantas has been mediocre, at best. The whole purpose for my wife's travel is now jeopardised and the resources she needs are in her luggage - she may have no other option than to return home. Given how much Qantas has been in the news recently (for the wrong reasons), you would think they'd be pulling out all the stops to impress - you're not learning, Qantas.",October 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

2,Very average business class and delayed,We used our frequent flyer points to treat ourselves to business class but overall it was disappointing. The flight was 1.5 hours late. The meal was average and they didn’t serve the bread and butter with the meal. No saucer provided with tea. Crew had a great time in the galley eating our meals and bread… nothing special. Glad I didn’t pay for it.,November 2023,4,4,4,1,1,3,3,2
1,Extremely disappointing,"Qantas has become unreliable inconsistent and severely lacking. I regularly fly domestic and international for work commitments using qantas as the chosen company airline.
In the recent few months cannot think of 1 flight that hasn’t had some level of change, from cancellations, rebooking and long delays, not to mention the poor service levels.

Is it a prerequisite when applying for a position with qantas that you need to be surly, rude and have an air of arrogance or is there dedicated training courses provided for the majority of employees? It is as if everyone is an inconvenience to the employees and the catering is not as expected for business class especially considering the vast amount charged.

Can qantas not stick to their original flight schedules and provide a decent level of customer service?

Extremely disappointing, Qantas should be ashamed to call itself Australia’s leading airline, I would be embarrassed if I was qantas.",October 2023,3,2,1,1,1,2,1,1
2,Poor Third in Domestic Stakes,"Having flown the other big 2 recently, this return trip to Melbourne for the Cox Plate gave me a chance to compare! The short version is that Qantas came in a very poor last place. Both flights were late leaving and in both cases no valid explanation was offered as to why?? One of our group had his luggage lost as well. Extremely cramped in cattle class on an over booked flight. There was next to no help at the automated check in & bag drop! No staff to be seen? I'm afraid that the rainbow leprechaun has left the building & a once great airline in a terrible state!!!",October 2023,2,2,1,2,3,3,2,-1
1,Treat disabled passengers with contempt.,"I made our reservation nine months ago and persuaded my wife that Premium Economy would be acceptable, because we booked the front row, so that I had legroom and nobody could push their seat back against my artificial knees. I am 6’ 4”, 20 stones, and have two artificial knees, chronic arthritis and cancer. Imagine my fury when we discovered that our seats had been changed to the worst seats, at the back of the cabin, and a little lady was sitting in my pre-booked seat. 17 hours of total discomfort. Cabin crew were helpful and found me a cabin jump seat, but I could not sit beside my wife.
When I arrived in Perth and wrote an outraged e-mail, I got a response that essentially said “f&&k you, we can do whatever we want to you”.
Never travel with this airline unless you are quite small, fully fit and don’t care less how you are treated.",November 2023,1,1,3,3,1,3,1,1
1,Abysmal Airline,Absolutely abysmal. They delayed our flight for over six hours in total (they kept pushing out boarding time and est take off). Apparently they frequently delay/cancel less profitable flights and just chuck customers on the next available flight to ensure that their planes are full. They also are not legally liable under Australian law for any inconveniences and costs incurred by them doing this. Would not recommend this airline to anyone.,November 2023,5,5,5,4,2,5,1,5
1,Cant Select Your Seat Until 24 hours prior to departure,"I booked 2 tickets directly on the Qantas website on September 5th and because the flight was 15 hours long I upgraded to Premium Economy. My flight is scheduled to depart on Jan 1, 2024.

At the beginning of November I was looking at my flight and noticed I hadn't been assigned a seat yet. I called the customer service line for North America and was advised that I cannot book a seat until 24 hours prior to departure. The seat configuration in premium economy is 2 - 3 - 2. Without the ability to book a seat when they charged me $7,000 at the time of booking means there is a possibility that I and my travel partner could end up with a middle seat and not sitting together. Normally I would consider this to be a small inconvenience however its a 15 hour flight and I am paying 7 times more than an economy ticket.

Qantas reported net income recently of 2.49 BILLION dollars. Good for them however they won't be getting another penny from me after this experience. I have written the CEO of Qantas, Venessa Hudson, no reply. I have written the chairman of the board of Qantas, no reply. I have written the CEO of customer service and no reply. Not having the ability to confirm a seat when I paid a huge premium is something I would expect from a low budget airline. When I purchased the seats I elected to have only a travel credit if I canceled. I would be happy to take a refund and fly with another airline that will confirm my seat but Qantas won't let me out of my obligation with a refund only a travel credit. BRUTAL customer service!",November 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Qantas business class needs to do better,"This flight did not deliver what Qantas business class promises.
For the first couple of hours, the entertainment system in one of our seats did not function. In another seat, while parts of the entertainment system worked well, the part that features maps and the route taken by the airline, produced a blank, black screen. When asked about the 'missing' maps, the flight attendant somewhat casually answered 'They have not been loaded'.
The food offered for the meal in the middle of the night, though tasty, was not appropriate. A generous serve of salmon on what seemed to be a bed of quinoa, though tasty, was not appealing. I ended up having a small plate of cheese and crackers, paired with a shiraz; both were excellent.
Next to my seat was a plastic storage-bin. I was about to use it, when I noticed that the inside of the bin looked very grubby. How regularly are these bins cleaned ?",September 2023,5,4,3,3,4,3,3,3
1,They steal your money them refuse to give it back,"In June our business had flights purchased for us by a boxing promoter to travel to a show. July 2023 I rang up to pay a $99 name change on one of the flights. They went on to charge me the $99 name change fee then the whole cost of all flights again (over $1870aud).

They found their fault, admitted it was an error but somehow it is November and I still haven't gotten my money back. For weeks every person told me something different, ""I was getting a refund just wait"", ""I needed to give a code to my bank"", ""they can't refund st george bank cards because st george and Qantas don't get along""?? (WTF)..
Every time I called I spent an hour on the phone.. it was ridiculous.. in August I got an email saying they were going to refund my money... on the email they had the correct card to be refunded but the wrong name despite me telling each of the 7 different people which card they needed to refund and the name on the card...

But of course... still no refund.. just lies again..

Currently have it in dispute with my bank and I'm hoping they can sort it out as $1900 is a lot of money...

They are now saying they refunded the original promoter (again despite me telling them over and over again which card needed to be refunded) but the boxing promoter says he hasn't received any refund so they are probably lying about that too.

Most untrustworthy company. And worst customer service I have every experienced.",July 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Brilliant service and caring airline,"Had a great experience today with this airline, I had to take my Aunty to her flight and she suffers from panic attacks and anxiety.

They put her on the plane first said they will look after and guide her right through her flight even at the other end they got a chair for her and they took her to get her laugage and straight to the lees That was picking her up , can’t say enough about this fantastic treatment of my Aunty. Great caring airline would travel with them anytime just brilliant service.",November 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

1,"Standard terrible service from Qantas, refusal to reimburse costs, cancelled and delayed flights","I was travelling from Adelaide to Accra in Ghana for a friend's wedding, and my very first flight (Qantas domestic) was to Melbourne. This flight was cancelled by Qantas, which meant i missed my connecting flight to Dubai and then Accra.

Qantas rebooked me to Sydney for the following morning, to go to Johannesburg and then to Accra. The Sydney-Johannesburg flight was then delayed due to 'scheduled maintenance' and I missed my connecting flight to Accra. The only way they could get me to Accra relatively quickly was to first fly to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, and from then to Accra.

Due to Qantas inability to provide the service paid for, I arrived 24 hours late and missed one of the wedding events. I also had to be picked up separately from the airport, causing added stress for the wedding party.

If this mess wasn't enough, owing to having to stay the night in Adelaide after my cancelled flight to Melbourne, I was provided a hotel and meal voucher of $50. The voucher clearly said $50. Regardless the hotel (Rydges) didn't believe the voucher was correct, and after I had ordered my meal ($41) they called Qantas to check the amount. Qantas apparently told them it should be $30, and so when I checked out at 4am the next morning they informed me they would be charging my card. At the airport, Qantas apologised and said that was wrong, and I would have to submit a claim online.

I did so after my flights were completed, only for Qantas to request more information and then tell me that as my booking was made with Emirates, I needed to go to them for reimbursement - even though the cancelled flight was Qantas operated, the hotel and meal voucher provided by Qantas, and Qantas staff provided the info of how to request reimbursement through them.

I replied to this email requesting more information, and lo and behold they called me while writing this review - it's a miracle. They have apologised and said they will reimburse me, after I reiterated what had happened and how it was them, not Emirates that provided the meal voucher.

I will be making further complaints about their abhorrent service and complete inability to provide the services people pay (a lot of money) for - don't trust they'll get better because of the bad publicity, they don't care about their customers or their reputation.",October 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Hours and hours on the phone over 2 days to change a single Business class flight, which couldn't be done on the their website or app which required that I changed both flights on the schedule. Then having even more trouble because they said my credit card was invalid - I didn't believe them but finally gave them another whch they used. I then rang the credit card company that they bounced and was advised that there was nothnig wrong with my card, and that they had had NO request from Qantas, digital or otherwise, for the payment. What did I learn? Not to book return or multiple flights, or even continuous flights with Qantas if it's going to be such a drama to change them, and most importantly, that years of loyalty count for nothing!",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Worst experience before we even began our holiday thanks to Qantas,"Our flight to Singapore was at midday so as suggested we arrived at the airport at 9.00am to check in. Once we checked in we received an email advising our flight had been delayed to 1.30pm. 1.30pm arrived and we were still at the airport with no official update. We approached the staff at the boarding lounge to only be told there were no updates and we would be advised when they have some news with the RUDEST tone. By 2.30pm we were given a $15 food vouch, what food can you buy for $15 at the airport? when it’s all so expensive, it was a joke and an insult.
We boarded the flight at 6pm which meant we were at the airport for 9 hours and all Qantas managed to provide for the passengers for the 9 hours of waiting was a $15 dollar food voucher and staff with the RUDEST attitude I have experienced. No customer service or care was give by the Qantas staff.
We have put in a complaint with Qantas and again they gave us the standard script written apology.
We would never fly or recommend Qantas again. What a shame Qantas you have lost your human touch and only focus on profit. 🤑",July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
2,Use to be good airline:(,"Use to be such a good airline together with Jetstar. Now, I am afraid to fly with them due to cancelations. Last 2 weeks - 2 cancelations. Tnx no.

1,Grow old on hold,Qantas in-air service is adequate; my complaint is the wait time to connect with an agent [46 minutes and counting] to correct an error in their booking. AGGH!,October 2023,3,3,3,1,2,-1,-1,-1
2,QANTAS not recommended,"This was my 2nd time flying with QANTAS in 5yrs for international travel. And both times the customer service is beyond par. My last trip to Europe left 4hrs late, leaving me in 2 different countries, missing my connecting flight and arrived to destination 9hrs late. There was no compassion, communication or some sort of refund for their error. Even when I'd paid for select seats. Not a great experience. This time my flight to and from Santiago were delayed. The ground staff were rude in both Oz and Santiago. The flight staff were very friendly and hospitable. My last flight from Santiago to Melbourne was delayed due to onloading people with special needs (wheelchairs) that weren't on time. That leaving over 250 passengers who did the right thing, leaving late. I'm not uncompassionate but we're all equal. We should not have been disadvantaged. I was notified my connecting flight from Sydney to Melbourne was cancelled. And QANTAS were making it ""their highest priority "" to get me another flight home. Upon arriving in Sydney, I had received no communication and had to navigate my way to a QANTAS desk to find out I was put on the last flight to Melbourne. Would've been nice to be told and not have the stress of how I was going to make it home after a long, delayed flight. I understand flights get delayed, cancelled etc. for different reasons. But relying on QANTAS to deliver class one customer service is not apparent anymore. It was interesting to hear other travellers with the same opinions that QANTAS is not at the level it should be, especially for the prices we pay. Along with these travellers, I will not fly or recommend QANTAS anytime soon. My recommendation is QATAR who have never let me down. Time for our national airline to treat their staff and customers with the service and respect we deserve. Or you will continue to lose loyal customers.",October 2023,3,3,5,3,3,4,4,4
1,Nightmare of an airline,"Absolute disgrace of a former glorious airline. Qantas club is outdated with poorest variety of food. I was literally had to depart on a quest for ice. The personnel instead of filling the empty bucket sent me on a quest to ""one of baristas should have it"".

Now about delays. These people shall be named as a leader in charter operations. They won't fly until aircraft is staffed with bodies (no longer you feel like a passenger) and the cargo. My flight on 27/10/2023 has been delayed twice.

I wouldn't book this flight if I didn't have that many points. Qantas, with Alan gone, you need to up your game to win the hearts and souls of the future customers. You lost mine. Go shopping qantas wine. with all these points.",October 2023,3,3,3,2,1,2,3,2
1,Qantas nosedive,"I took a connecting flight to Sydney on 11 October 2023. On 9th October 2023 I received a message from Qantas that my flight QF436 departing from Melbourne to Sydney at 11am has been cancelled and my new flight QF428 will depart at 9.15am. When I arrived in Melbourne around 7.20am, I had to go through Quarantine queue due to the outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in Bali. I was nervous that I may miss my connecting flight as it happened in November 2022 when my wife and I missed my connecting flight from Melbourne to Sydney due to the late arrival of Qantas flight from Delhi followed by inordinate delay in the arrival of our luggage ( outsourcing of luggage services by Qantas). Not only did we miss our connecting flight, we had to face a very arrogant. Qantas staff member at the conveyer belt who threatened me that her supervisor would deal with me when I check in at the Domestic Terminal ( and it actually happened), and then we were booked on a much later flight and downgraded from the Business class to the Economy class cabin by the Supervisor (vengeance the most probable cause). It took us 11 months to get the refund after many phone calls and filling up forms. We were actually advised to furnish our boarding passes to prove that we actually travelled in Economy class ( wow - that’s a new low by Qantas - their systems are so inefficient I assume).

Now coming back to the latest issue. I was really worried that I may miss my flight just like it happened last November and may be downgraded from business class to economy on the new flight ( I heard that Qantas keep the details of customers like me on their systems) and it may take for ever to get a refund! Luckily, I made it to the flight!!! When my hostess (probably her name was Lynette) came to my seat to take my brekky order, I found out that there was no veg option available and all 3 options had meat or eggs. I raised my concern that Qantas was an international airline of repute and it should also cater to a growing number of vegan/veg travellers and I was not impressed. She then organised a museli bar and yoghurt from the poor Economy class cousin!!! Later I tried to apologise to her just outside the cockpit. She lost her cool and reprimanded me for my attitude. She told me that it was just a 56 minutes flight and I was so concerned about food options! She missed the whole point - it wasn’t about food. It was about customer service - no apology, no vegan/veg food options in so called Business class followed by a threat that she would raise a report against me. I am so worried that Qantas may blacklist me and I may never get an invitation to the secretive Chairman’s/ Chairwoman’s Lounge.

Change of Top Management but no change in staff attitude. If they treat Business class travellers, God bless the Economy class travellers. The End Result:

1. Qantas nosediving from 5th to 17th position for international airlines.
2. Virgin overtaking Qantas as the preferred National career.
3. Qantas shares falling down.
4. Senate inquiry into Qantas affairs - thanks Mr Alan Joyce!

What next: Goodbye Qantas within next 12 months unless things change for good. There are bigger horror stories that I have heard from other travellers and I sincerely sympathise with them as their painful stories have lessened the effect of my pain in last 2 years or so!!!",September 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Do not fly.,"Booked a flight direct through Qantas at 16:36hrs to fly at 20:55hrs the same day due to an emergency. Upon arriving at the check in desk 3hrs before flying, we were informed that the flight had been delayed overnight by 12 hours and would depart at 9am the following morning.
The following morning, whilst waiting for check in again, we were informed by some other passengers that they were informed of the delay 48 hours before. We still had no email, text or other correspondence stating this. This meant that Qantas were still selling flights for the original flight time knowing full well that the flight was delayed substantially. This is outrageous!
Whilst waiting on the tarmac after being delayed, yet again... I received an email at 09:26 to say that my original flight had been delayed 9.5hrs afterwards!

In addition, when on board i was greeted by defective entertainment screen as the touch screen was infrequently working on top of the USB charging port not working whatsoever! I requested to change seat but was informed that the flight was full and it was not possible.

Whilst stopping in Singapore for 45 minutes, and then boarding the same aircraft, albeit a different seat. We were greeted by unchanged, stained pillows from previous passengers in those seats. A damn right disgrace.

A nightmare from start to finish with Qantas.",October 2023,3,3,1,1,2,1,1,4
1,Qantas business class service very poor,Flight cancelled due to engine valve issue departure was due at 9.30am. Qantas booked business class passengers with 27 hour delay economy passenger only a 9 hour delay. Option not provided to fly economy,October 2023,3,2,3,1,3,4,1,3
4,Qantas - not the flavour of the month - But!! still delivering.,"Qantas - may not be everyone's favourite at present and certainly still have a ways to go to lift their overall product and service to their main Australian public customers. But once again and fortunately for us, the flying Kangaroo delivered a 7.5 to 8 experience on our short hop over to NZ from Sydney.
QF3 is a one stop at Auckland on route to NYC and luckily we only had the short 3 hour first leg and not the extended 16 hour marathon.
The flight was slightly delayed out of Sydney about 30-40 mins from memory - incoming flight delayed and this aircraft had to be towed over from hanger. Newer 787 dreamliner from Boeing no less.
Baggage drop off at Kingsford Smith was a do it yourself affair as is pretty common now and quite flawless and with printed boarding pass in hand it was a smooth passage though boarder control and security for a quick bite and beverage before heading up to the gate.
Qantas gate attendants were great and we did get some announcements to keep us informed of progress on the delay and anticipated time for our new carriage to arrive. Staff were observant and without any prompting at boarding allowed our group to board early as one of us has some mobility difficulties. This worked out fantastic as we were seated towards the rear of the plane and greatly assisted minimise extended standing to get aboard. A very big thank you to the attentive staff and a big tick to Qantas and their passenger care.
The plane was a newer aircraft and seating etc good, pleasantly surprised to find no entertainment box on the floor under the seats to obstruct leg/foot room as is the case with some 787's. Not the biggest screen, nor the best legroom or width but on par with this product and seating class. There was an issue with the head phone jack connection to the armrest that was faulty and interfered with watching movies etc. Was reported to cabin staff. Was tolerable for 3 hours but would be a real pain in the - you know what - if having to jingle the connector for 16hrs. Plane was pretty full.
The entertainment is usual Qantas fair and overall would rate it as pretty good and better than most (excepting Emirates and Qatar). Very happy with product.
On board service and cabin crew were great - no complaint or issue - pleasant, friendly and did their jobs well.
Food - was surprisingly good and tasty - excellent for the short 3 hr hop and 8 out of 10. Have had some very poor offerings from Qantas on other trips but great on this one.
We got to NZ a little behind time but luckily for us no biggy
As usual Qantas delivered with meeting their primary obligations in my view; Got us up safely, flew us over safely and got us down safely without issue or incident - just what i'd expect and paid for. The delay is fine and happy to sit in an airport or fly next day if there are any safety issues rather than have a drama in the air. The nice food and great service were nice bonuses to have and appreciated.
To my experience - generally Qantas have delivered a 7.5 to 8 level of service. Very happy on this occasion and would use and recommend Qantas in future.
PS. Qantas needs to significantly improve its web/phone customer service experience as on previous occasions it has been atrocious. But their main product is generally pretty good.",October 2023,3,3,4,5,4,4,5,5
1,Disappointing booking experience,"Paid $450 more for an Emirates 'code share' flight than I would have had I gone directly to Emirates for a Brisbane to London return flight June 2024 so not taken yet but being a loyal Aussie thought I would support my own airline- how wrong I was !

QANTAS web site is a mickey mouse nonsense that sends you round in circles and tells you nothing eg. advice on Web and Phone etc encourages you to select your seats via Manage Bookings but it does not advise that if you have a code share booking you need to go directly to the airline.

Had to change the outward flight and was charged $500 noting if I cancelled it would be no charge but of course by then I had paid for preferred seating with Emirates so would have lost that.

Too many other frustrating incompetency's to mention but suffice to say I am done with them and will always be so disappointed at the greed and incompetence. Just compare the QANTAS and Emirates web sites (for example) and you will see straight away what I mean - trying to get through to QANTAS - 30 minutes on the phone trying several times and the only other com is via the web links. Emirates ? 1 minute on a live chat and exceptional professional service and the list goes on.",October 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Average flight experience,"I have always chosen to fly with Qantas due to its outstanding safety record. On this occasion, I found the flight experience to be average. We were on an A330-200 plane, but the main concern was the limited space. The narrow aisle and tight seat arrangement made it very uncomfortable for such a long 14 hour flight. Additionally, the entertainment system was outdated and challenging to use. Meal was average as well. Overall it was a disappointing experience.",October 2023,2,3,2,5,3,5,5,3
3,Rare cancellation info,"Domestic travel in Australia. Rules on luggage size to check in but frankly they checked weight or not at all.

Flight was canceled due to mechanical problems and pilot said not occurred for him once every 5 years.pilot did communicate periodically to update at the terminal. Best to stay at terminal for info. Best to have created an account w also included phone number so they could have texted hotel and reroute they booked on the back end they did afterwards as we just waited. They gave us taxi vouchers and food credit at a local hotel and apologetic though they arranged for others w connecting flights onto another company based on connections and frequent flyer status they said

1,can see why Qantas get such bad reviews,"I can see why qantas gets such bad reviews, Despite Alan Joyce (who I could never stand, so refused to fly Qantas until he was gone). The staff at Melbourne airport were incredibly unhelpful when asked the most basic of questions. I experienced this myself, and observed this pathetic attitude of qantas staff with other passengers as well. Clearly it was not just the former CEO's manner that affected their disintegration in the Australian public eyes. I do accept people in work places have bad days, however when it is multiple staff, including airline crew, with a consistent unhelpful bad attitude, it sems to be an inherent workplace ethos of 'screw the customer, we already have your $$ now we simply do not care'. This was reflected on both a domestic flight to Sydney, then the continuing flight to Nadi. I will now go back to not flying Qantas.",September 2023,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,1

There was only one check-in agent at terminal 3 and when we went to check-in a terminal 4, they ushered everyone to the other terminal. It took an hour to get through and there were 5 check-in agents when we left. The flight though was very good. The cabin crew were friendly and the premium economy seats were very nice and comfy. The food was exceptional and it was easy getting into Melbourne.",September 2023,4,5,4,4,4,5,2,5
3,Yet another average Qantas experience,This was a morning domestic flight and was all fine. The egg frittatas were nice but we needed cutlery to eat them.

5,Great QantasLink Service,"My 94 year-old mother and I flew with QantasLink recently and all the check-in, ground crew and inflight staff were unfailingly friendly, helpful and respectful. The online booking process was straight forward and it was easy to add Mum's mobility needs to the booking. We were seated near the front of the cabin and at check-in the staff checked with Mum what would be the easiest way for her to board and ensured that there would be a buggy to take her to the baggage collection area once we were in Brisbane. We were boarded first and the inflight staff were just as attentive. I was dreading this flight given the reports you hear of poor airline service these days, but our experience was so relaxed and positive. Thank you QantasLink.",September 2023,4,4,-1,5,3,4,5,3

Their staff in Sydney airport were probably sent from nursing home !! All were over age of 70 with hard time of communicating. Costumer service skill zero .

1,Qantas Has Gone To The Dogs,"More disgusting service from everyone's favourite airline... 50% more expensive than JetStar and still the same abysmal service.

They sent me an invitation to buy a one time use of their Qantas Lounge in Melbourne. since I had a 3 hour stop there I thought it would be a nice idea to try it out...

Now keep in mind, that some genius in their marketing department thought it would be a good idea to razzle dazzle a new potential regular customer by sending me this special ""VIP Offer"". You know, let me experience how wonderful the lounge is and then I might buy permanent access to it and further improve their fat profits.

I thought it was odd that they only sent the invite to me and not my wife who was travelling with me. But the invite said I could forward it to the others I was travelling with and they can enjoy it to. Sadly or should I say expectedly, no matter how we tried to use the pass, access the site or complete a 2nd purchase their system would not allow me to do so.

I figured if I bought one and they were trying to convince me to become a full fee paying client I would simply be able to explain the website issues and buy the 2nd pass at the counter when I walked in.

Alas, it was not to be. all I got was excuses, BS rules about this and that and then a bunch of terse mouthy rudeness from the catty ladies when I displayed the slightest bit of frustration at their lack of ability to fix a simple situation. ""Your welcome to use YOUR pass Sir"" yea.. i'll just wave at my wife through the window while I enjoy my free coffee you idiots.

Once again, Qantas could have made money, pleased a customer and made flying with them a pleasure, but instead they ensured I will do everything I can to avoid flying with them again.

PS: After flying Air NZ on the way over and enjoying their nearly NEW plane, with complimentary FREE Wifi, and lovely staff with great service, the stark difference in how not to do things by Qantas was pulpable. every metric was comparably, utter garbage compared to Air NZ. I hope these clowns get smoked by the government for embarrassing themselves and the country. They were great once, but sadly they've been managed into the dirt by corporate greed.",October 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

2,"Great when you are actually on the flight, but customer service/reservations are a NIGHTMARE!","Qantas has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I tried to book a flight for my family of four, including my two young children, during their 'North America Red Tail Sale'. However, the website wouldn't let me book a seat for my infant son who is 19 months old, so I had to call.

Long story short, after four hours of phone calls with Qantas reservations, they made several promises they couldn't keep and cancelled my son's booking without any notice. I was told a supervisor would call me back between 11am-3pm over a week ago (we still have not heard from anyone).

Originally, when we booked, my son's seat should have only been $1100 which we were assured by reservations that they would honour. Many hours on the phone, false promises and cancelled bookings later - I was forced to have my infant son on my lap for the 30+ hours of travel for a fee of $236 or pay an additional $4,000+ for him to have his seat.

I am extremely disappointed with Qantas and will never be flying with them again. I urge everyone else to avoid Qantas at all costs.

Especially for those that are booking a seat for an infant (because we know having an almost two year old on your lap for 15 hours is not fun).... DON'T FLY QANTAS! THEY MAKE INFANT SEATS MORE EXPENSIVE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO BOOK. This is the second time I have experienced this issue with them and it will be the last.

1,Absolute disgrace,"Alan Joyce should be sent to jail, or at the very least not be paid his bonus, for his utter incompetence and abject failure of leadership which has run the national carrier into the ground over the course of his stewardship. As an international traveller, I have purposefully avoided flying with Qantas due to its poor reputation. However, this time my luck ran out.

The Australian legs of my flight to NZ were code-share with Qantas, both of which did not depart on time. On the evening flight from Perth to Melbourne (3.5 hours) we were served a chicken panini (a small, dry panini bun with barely any chicken) and nothing else. I was also dismayed to note there were no seat-back screens and passengers were instead supplied with iPads to watch movies etc., which could be dangled from the seat in front. (Is this some kind of new-fangled fad or just really old aeroplanes?). On my return journey from Sydney to Perth (4 hours), there were no iPads and passengers instead were required to download the Qantas app and watch movies on their personal devices, in my case a humble iPhone which gave me neck, eye and arm strain as I struggled through a movie. I selected the beef ragout w/ pasta and looked forward to a hearty meal. Alas, it was served in a cardboard box and the meal itself was overcooked and tasteless; the only reason I forged ahead was out of pure hunger. Later on we were given a KitKat chocolate. By contrast Air New Zealand were fantastic: seat-back screens and delicious meals served on an actual tray complete with hot bun, salad and a dessert (and this even though the flights to/from Christchuch were just over 3 hours). I genuinely hope that new management will restore Qantas to an airline that its staff and the country can be proud of. Until then, I shall continue to purposefully avoid flying with Qantas.",September 2023,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1
1,Customer service staff are useless...,"We had so many problems. They changed our connecting flight to leave before we landed, we lost our exit row seats in the new flights, its been 4 months ad I am still waiting on my refund. The customer service staff on email, phone (logged about 10 hours with these people) and instagram are all useless, all have different understandings of their policies. i really didnt even want to go on my trip with them in the end.

We get on our flight, and there is an issue with the weather radar, we turned around and flew home. they put us up in a hotel and fed us.

Next flights to and from the US were awesome. The flight staff are the heart of the airline. I wish the customer service people were the same.

f there was no need to interact with customer service, it would be 5 stars.",October 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Don’t fly with Qantas. Set your expectations to zero if you do.,"Flight cancelled then downgraded from business to economy and separated from my husband in economy class. Could not have received worse service from the staff at Qantas today. Seriously disappointing when you’re a repeat paying customer. Fix your processes and train your staff to be decent human beings. Absolutely disgusted by this airline, I’ll be looking to fly with different airlines in the future because of this.

No compensation or apology for the inconvenience just basically told too bad this is your only option to fly today or you can fly tomorrow.",September 2023,1,1,1,-1,1,1,1,1
1,Just as bad as budget airlines. Why pay extra.,"My husband and I had paid for business class tickets from Melbourne to Hamilton island. We got to the airport, checked in and were advised our flight from Melbourne to Sydney was delayed due to staff sickness which meant we would miss our subsequent flight from Sydney to Hamilton island. The only options we were given was for one person to be downgraded to economy on the first leg and then for both of us to be downgraded on the second leg but we would have to sit seperately for the entire journey or for both of us to fly with Jetstar and sit together in economy. We haven’t been compensated for the fare and they have offered absolutely nothing for the inconvenience. Do better Qantas you’re supposed to be the premium airline in Australia and that is not what we have experienced today.",September 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Worst experience,"We thought Qantas was a good airline and, being Australian we were happy to be returning home on the Aussie airline. How wrong we were! The trip was terrible. The seats were far too narrow and there was hardly any legroom to stretch our legs. We travelled economy class, but this experience was ridiculous! We got a small bottle of water at the beginning of the flight and that was it for the rest of the (15 hour) flight! Then the staff disappeared for about ten hours. We were served a meal about ten hours into the flight and it was the worst meal ever! Apart from being a tiny amount it was tasteless and hard to tell what it was. This was the first time in our (many) years of flying we were actually starving on a flight! We were not offered any more water except with the meal. We got another packaged ""meal""(a piece of something ...in a paper box) a little later on but we did not eat it because it was virtually rubbish and we put it in the bin. We noticed other passengers doing the same thing. The staff were unhelpful and not friendly at all. When we complained to one of them about the meal he said ""Go to MacDonald's""! We will never fly Qantas again.",September 2023,1,1,2,1,1,2,4,1
1,Worst,"Horrible service, budget food which was stale and out of taste.
If allowed take your own food and alcohol",October 2023,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1
1,Qantas First Class is really just cattle class at the front of the plane. Rip off.,"First class SO NOT WORTH THE PRICE. The service is okay but the food and the bedding and amenities are soooooooo far off what is available on other airlines. Rather fly Emirates or Singapore or Qatar and have a well rested, high end experience with quality service and dining as well as an elegant lounge visit.

Qantas First Class is really just cattle class at the front of the plane.",August 2023,1,1,1,2,1,2,3,1
4,Will fly Qantas again happily,"Just balancing out the negative reviews as I had a great experience on my recent long-haul flight. Given all the recent negativity I was a little nervous about flying Qantas, but honestly I didn't have any issues and will happily fly with them again!
Breezed through check-in with friendly staff. The flight was right on time for both legs of the journey. A brief 10min wait on the tarmac at Singapore due to another plane's technical difficulties was communicated to us quickly.
My luggage was transferred from a Qantas domestic flight to the international flight with no issues at all.
Seats & leg room were comfortable, certainly better than I've had on other flights.
Staff were friendly and polite, I noticed them being extremely helpful attending to other passenger requests around me.
Food was adequate, a bit heavy for a long-haul flight and not much in the way of fresh salad/fruit. The snack bar at the back of the plane was great, easy to grab a drink & some snacks anytime (even pre-departure!).
Entertainment system was good, a mix of new releases of old favourites. A few people were having issues with the touchscreens not working well (myself included) but the remote worked fine so didn't really interfere with viewing.",September 2023,4,4,4,5,4,4,5,3
2,This once was an excellent airline,"I fly a lot with Qantas - Platinum F/F for past 6 years. The last two trips internationally in economy have been dreadful.
The staff seem so demotivated and gloomy and the service is poor. It appears they are cost saving with the meals - the scrambled eggs served for breakfast had a nauseating smell of sulphur
Their customer service may be so overwhelmed that they cant cope - emails to them get a standard reply they bears no relation to the complaint.",August 2023,4,4,2,1,2,3,3,1
5,On time departure,"The flight left on time and was uneventful.

Upon check in I asked if there were any exit row seats for more leg room but as it was a full flight this request couldnt be granted.

As the flight was a late afternoon flight we received a complimentary drink which included alcoholic drinks. I had a glass of wine. This was served with crackers and dip.",August 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Never again!,Originally delayed from 23:05 to 01:30. This meant we would miss our connecting flight and have an 11 hour layover until the next connecting flight. Then couldn't get another flight because they were fully booked on all flights - okay others are in same situation - but then agent says (when asked about compensation etc.) it is only a nine hour delay. WTF? But then we get another text just before leaving for the airport that the flight is delayed … again … until 6am. So thankfully we were able to get a place to sleep but disgusting service from Qantas! Would not recommend for flight Bali!,September 2023,2,2,3,4,1,2,1,2
5,So glad we flew with Qantas!,"Last weekend, our extended family attended a wedding in Canberra. We were unable to change our seatings online, so were delighted when the Qantas lady at the check-in counter kindly offered us 5 consecutive seats. Our Qantas flight from Brisbane was delayed due to the hailstorm but our return flight was on time. My poor SIL’s family & some friends from Brisbane who also attended the wedding, flew with another airline. Unfortunately for them, their flight was cancelled at the last minute & they had to return to Brisbane from Canberra via a layover in Melbourne! We thought we were so lucky flying with Qantas… until we collected our luggage on arrival & discovered 1 of our checked suitcases had big cracks at the top! The kind & helpful lady at the Qantas Baggage Claims counter helped us initiate the complaint & gave us a form with instructions on how to lodge it online. The next day, we lodged our complaint but didn’t hold much hope! To our surprise, we’d received a reply within 5 minutes from Julius, a Qantas Customer Care rep. He was very courteous, apologetic, & offered us a brand new replacement suitcase! And this afternoon, only 5 days after our complaint, our impressive, new suitcase arrived! We are delighted & impressed with how efficient & professional Qantas had handled & solved our problem. So, from now on, we will only trust & fly with Qantas!",October 2023,4,4,-1,5,5,5,4,4
1,QANTAS SUCKS!!!,"QANTAS,YOU SUCK!!!Firstly,we had to wait 25 minutes on the tarmac for our bay because qantas is incapable of on time departure. Additionally, on arrival it took over an hour to receive our baggage. Not to mention the disgusting food options/ lack of options provided during the service. I would HIGHY RECOMMEND NOT TO PAY THE EXTRA MONEY TO FLY WITH QANTAS.",October 2023,3,3,3,5,1,1,3,1
1,I'll never fly with Qantas (or Jetstar) again,"I'll never fly with Qantas again; my recent trip to the UK was the final straw.

After enduring years of constant flight delays and cancellations, unhelpful customer service agents, rude airport staff, and frustrating refund delays, the last incident pushed me over the edge.

Qantas cancelled our London Heathrow to Brisbane flight and rebooked us on a Heathrow to Sydney flight with a 24-hour layover in Sydney before connecting to Brisbane.

This resulted in over 51 hours of travel time, causing significant disruptions to our plans, including school schedules. Despite enduring a 12-hour delay in London, a 14-hour (delayed) flight to Singapore, a 2-hour layover, a 24-hour layover in Sydney, and a 1.5-hour flight to Brisbane, Qantas seemed indifferent to our ordeal.

It's clear they prioritize profit over customer and staff satisfaction, and it's time for them to reverse that equation.

Qantas, as Australia's national airline, receiving substantial government support, should provide better service. We deserve more.",September 2023,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1
5,Best service received,Recently was coming from Europe trip. First 2 flights were with Emirates airline from Copenhagen and my last flight from Bangkok to Sydney with Qantas. I have to say flight with qantas airline was absulutly amazing. The crew was just so hospitable and friendly and so helpful. They looked after all passangers and with food and drinks all the way though the flight. They always did with smile and nothing was ever too difficult. Compare to my first 2 flights which were comfortable but the service was just not there at all I have to say I wish I can fly with qantas all the way to Europe instead. I always look forward flying with qantas once I get to Singapore or Bangkok to Sydney. Thank you qantas for amazing service.,September 2023,4,5,4,5,5,5,5,5

Particularly airport desk are absolutely useless
Their training package must be say no .....the end",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Not as it used to be,"What happened to Qantas! ? On an international business class trip there was no wifi, the service was indifferent and the food was very disappointing. On two recent trips to Melbourne one flight was so delayed that I missed my connection and had to overnight in Melbourne, on the second the original flight was cancelled and the next was delayed twice resulting in a very rushed and stressed passage through immigration. Never again!",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Lost bags and cancelled flights,As Qantas suggest getting to the airport early for an international flight I arrived 2 hours before my flight. Baggage drop didn't open until 1 hour before my flight. I had a connecting flight in Melbourne that was cancelled. They then booked me on a flight 11 hours later in the middle of the night leaving me stranded in the airport for 13 hours and unable to make it to my accommodation which they haven't reimbursed me for. Now they have lost my bags and no one can tell me where they are. Every step has been a nightmare. The staff unhelpful. Our national carrier is an embarrassment.,October 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Worst Airline and Worst Customer Service,"Worst airline I’ve traveled with. Worst customer service. CSR’s aren’t trained and hang up in the middle of call, happened twice. She was yawning on the call and was asking me price of their products, lol. Both flights delayed. They canceled my flight in error and no one could help at Sydney airport, they all looked dumb like they had no idea what’s happening. I wouldn’t recommend this airline even if its coming cheap. No one will assist or aren’t trained well to assist. Keep extra cash for another flight if you do fly with this airline.",October 2023,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,2
1,Time to lift your Gabe Qantas,"Avoid travelling with Qantas unless you are happy with delays and waiting for endless hours to speak to pathetic customer service representatives who can’t actually assist you when things go wrong. Qantas has gone from a first class airline to something that is far below the service of a budget low cost airline. All other airlines seem to have got it right post COVID, Qantas has got even worse. Time to lift your game Qantas!",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,The best ever!!!,"The best ever service.Unfortunately I am saying this with irony.Had an international flight that got delayed with 5 hours and therefore I missed all my other flights.And this surprise has been presented to me 6 hours before the flight.And it's even more wonderful,because nobody answered the phone and I got rebooked automatically for some random flight,that arrives 10 hours later.No problem...at least they gave me 15 Aud voucher.What a gesture!Never again with this cheaters.Better use low cost airline",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Horrifying baggage excuses yet again,"Yet again QANTAS proves why they generate such a level of anger and abhorrence. Bag got lost and after multiple calls to the airlines lost baggage number were you listen to a 1 minute 20 second recording of “excuses for how hard the airline baggage business is” is says “leave a message l”. Of course you never hear back from anyone, and why would they … they are Qantas and above the issues of common customers. The Platinum 1 line says “well you’ll have to drive 2 hours back to the airport … chuckle”. Still don’t trust them and finally get through to someone at Queenstown who says they have the bag so drove out and so long as here before 8 pm you’ll be fine. Third trip to the airport and after a 2 hour drive we get told “Sorry Qantas has all gone home and you will have to come back tomorrow”. Qantas is the worst airline on the planet period. I avoid them like the plague and so should you.",September 2023,2,2,1,3,1,1,3,1
3,Flying Kangaroo now 3rd rate,"Have flown Business Class long haul in Singapore Airlines, Luftansa and Qantas the last month. Apart from the lounges, Qantas rates third by a long shot. Have flown QF religiously for 30 years and my recent QF flight epitomises how far they have fallen. Inflight food was barely edible, no snacks, staff disappeared after food service. The Business module is coffin like. QF is also more expensive for a poorer experience. Using points is also just about impossible.",August 2023,4,3,4,3,2,4,4,2
1,Never again Qantas,"Do not waste your money booking with qantas, they don’t care about their customers, cancelled flight after delaying for a hour and a half, then blank faces from their staff at the customer service desk and no answers, you are basically left to work something out for yourself.
Might as well book with lower budget airline.",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Poor meals,"Whilst the crew members were very friendly and helpful the overall experience was rather poor. We ordered vegan meals and had already travelled with Singapore airlines so had something to compare to. Quantus meals were dreadful by comparison! On a long haul flight mealtimes are often a highlight and we were left bitterly disappointed, the meal was nutritionally deficient, boring, flavourless and not particularly generous, unlike Singapore airlines. The in-flight entertainment system also had no music.",September 2023,4,4,2,5,3,4,5,1
1,Karan Patel disgrace Msssecurity,"My recent experience with Qantas security staff Karan Patel and Jai Patel at Brisbane Airport left me utterly horrified and deeply concerned for the safety of passengers. Their appalling behaviour and lackadaisical attitude towards security measures were beyond comprehension.
From the moment I stepped into the security checkpoint, it was evident that the Qantas security staff were disinterested, disengaged, and lacked the professionalism one expects in such a critical role. Their negligent approach to screening and interacting with passengers was truly shocking.
The complete disregard for basic security protocols was alarming. It seemed as though the staff were more interested in rushing through the process than ensuring the safety of passengers. Their lack of attention to detail and failure to identify potential threats was deeply unsettling.",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,The Fawlty Towers of airlines,"we had to use Qantas on one sector to LON. We departed CBR well after 3 cancellations in a row we were placed in a flight in time for our connection. Fail, due to a communication error we missed our connection to Hong Kong. Qantas auto re checked us into QF1 without our knowing to add to this they lost our bags. We spent 3 hours at Sydney airport going between 2 baggage claim offices riding the Qantas transfer buses. Qantas customer services and baggage none of the desks were manned. We called Qantas no one knew what to do because they tire you out by putting you on hold or hanging up. Finally we got to the Qantas lounge with the clothes on our back and watched an elderly lady fall off a chair after the leg broke. Seems nothing at Qantas works! At time of writing now 48 hours later our bag remains missing when calling the Qantas customer service they re route you to Global Bags Service who cannot help as UK systems are not compatible with Australia systems so the reference number is not able to be detected to track and trace the bags whereabouts there is a also a 084 Qantas number in UK but that charges you 7p a minute to call Qantas it appears they certainly have services that makes one run around!
Belated entry: 5 days later Qantas have found our bag in Hong Kong on our flight to London via Singapore. Actually Qantas didn’t find it a company called Global Baggage Solutions, Vladimir did whoever he is we are indebted to him for going the mile. I won’t be writing anymore reviews after this about Qantas as we won’t be flying this airline. My advice to the consumer with Qantas, 2 words ‘buyer beware’.",March 2023,3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1
1,Terrible ground experience,"Travelling from Brisbane to Christchurch via Sydney and the checkin experience was awful. Please bring back more people to assist with service.
Bag drop was confusing. Only one person running between bag drops to assist customers. Long queues for 2 other ground staff for customers who had questions.
The app does not replace the human touch. The new service is impersonal and unpleasant. It's so much better starting a trip with a friendly airline representative assisting and giving assurances. We were directed to one and felt relieved to be given time and necessary information that a scanner can not. Bring back more staff!",August 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Ruined our first little family trip,"This airline ruined my young family's first holiday with their poor service, mean meal offerings and busted in-flight entertainment. This airline is run by white-collar criminals who illegally fire their workers, and then pocket their $ to pay themselves bonuses. All of the board and upper management need to be fired. Bring in people who care about their customers and staff. We don't want these parasites running things anymore.",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Pathetic service.",July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Better off flying Virgin,"So 4pm on a Qantas flight and sold as a full service flight. Simply not True. Can't get a wine or a beer, super expensive flight and super simple snack.

At least on virgin you have an option to buy something to drink or something worth eating. Such poor service on Qantas, what a fall from grace.",September 2023,3,2,2,1,1,3,3,1
5,Pleasant flight on the Dash 8,"Good check-in, staff pleasant and changed my seat on request. Boarded on time. Supplied with morning tea including a small cake that was yummy. Cabin crew very friendly and offered seconds. One of the cabin crew greeted each passenger by their name and repeated it during the flight.
No inflight entertainment but not sure if any Dash 8 planes offer than anywhere (and it is only 40 min in the air). Cost a bit more than the opposition but considering I was heading overseas and had a large bag there were no issues (I would have had to pay extra on the other airline).",September 2023,4,4,-1,5,3,5,5,5
5,Qantas,"Jetset Airlines cancelled my trip along with other trips as lack of crew. They refused to help as I did not book online but through Flight Centre and they said to ring them up. I did and after 20 minutes got onto them, and they said there was one seat left on the 67-10am flight the next day and put me on that. However, when I saw Qantas staff at 4-30am they said my name was there but an X by it as not booked. They also said m y name was not on the 6-15pm flight that Jetstar airways set they booked. After a lot of going back and forth. The lady booked by bag in and printed my seat number and I got the last seat a on the plane and just got on before the plane left. The food was good, plenty of drinks and chocolate cookies. On Jetstar it cost $4-00 just for a soft drink and you pay for checked in luggage but a much cheaper fare, as I was told the fare was $2000 but hopefully, they did not charge my Visa as not authorized to do so. I told Georgie the hostess how good Qantas was and how bad Jetstar was and that I would be putting in a Trip Advisor review. She seemed pleased and was a real nice lady.",September 2023,5,5,1,5,2,5,3,5
2,services has really deteriorated over time,"This used to be the beloved Aussie airline. These days, however, you'd be lucky if they get you from A to B without any major drama. The lounge is horrible and most basic, you have to wait for hours to just talk to someone (who is very often untrained), they never provide any compensation or reasonable solution even when they are at fault, and their food is getting really really bad. so disappointed.",August 2023,3,3,3,1,1,3,5,2

8 out of 9 flights delayed. 4 times lost luggage and having anyone on the phone is IMPOSSIBLE. Staff point to a QR code where you lodge lost luggage and you refresh - this airline is honestly a ongoing, understaffed, constantly delayed company.

The picture is us on a bus, we were asked to get on at 12.25pm for a 11.55am scheduled flight - it is bow 1.03pm and we are still waiting for the plane to be ready to board. This is a normal situation for QANTAS … hopeless.",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,1,-1

1,Qantas still failing.,"Thanks Qantas for still failing your customers with atrocious service. Vanessa Hudson your comments and promises are meaningless!
Booked party of 10 to Vanuatu back in May this year through travel agent on Qantas flight QF3527. Received booking confirmation from Qantas, e-tickets from Qantas. Yesterday 23/09/23 at 7:00pm the night before our supposed flight today @ 10:55am received text message saying our flight had been cancelled and to click web link and contact airline for additional information. Web link resulted in web page not displayed. So after 10 of us had travelled by train, booked overnight hotel accommodation at Sydney airport we decided to visit Qantas desk in Sydney airport. Here's where it gets interesting. Qantas rep says nothing to do with us as it is code share operated by Air Vanuatu and need to contact them. Air Vanuatu confirmed plane at Brisbane awaiting urgent repairs since THURSDAY 21st. THERE HAD BEEN NO FLIGHTS SINCE THIS TIME TO VANUATU AS THEY ONLY HAVE ONE, YES ONE, PLANE! Unbelievable!!! Asked if we could be rebooked on a later flight and no one had any idea when flights would resume. So requested Qantas assist with flight rebooking/refund for flight and accommodation in Vanuatu and they said not our problem need to speak to Air Vanuatu in the morning. This is now 10:00pm the night before our supposed flight at 10:50 the next morning.
We arrive at Air Vanuatu desk at 8:00 am today 24/09/2023 to ask what's going to happen only to be told no flight and unknown when service resumes. Asked as codeshare and all previous correspondence, payments, notifications from Qantas can they get us on an alternate flight answer - no!. Responsibility of Air Vanuatu. Vanessa just not good enough! The once proud airline of Australia has been.turned into a pariah of the airways due to inept management, bloated corporate salaries, disdain for the flying public and what can only be described as borderline fraudulent business practices knowingly obtaining money for goods and services that can not be delivered.
If I could give negative stars I most definitely would.
If by chance any Qantas customer service person ( I use the term loosely) by chance reads this review I hope you can pass it along the chain of management and hopefully onto the desk of the new CEO.
In future I will attempt every measure possible not to use this carrier and advise anyone else to do the same until such time you again become honourable in your trading and value your customers.",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Qantas totally changed and not family friendly in this economy - only care about exec bonus not customers,"We booked a return ticket to Mexico over a year ago for a holiday. Things changed and needed to get home two days earlier, cost to change flights to same flights two days earlier over $3500k for economy. Entire trip cost less then that return for two people. They had plenty of seats to come out earlier. Rather than fill the flight and give others opportunities of our seats later, in a crisis, they heard my tears and no doubt saw dollar signs. Qantas made 1.7billion this year and tried to charge me $3500 to take an empty economy seat two days early. Been a loyal customer for 20 years and had a few other trips this year. Made no difference. How is that market rate? Bring on Qatar!",September 2023,2,2,3,1,1,1,2,2
1,Inedible food !!,"Qantas, what the hell has happened to the food you serve?. The food given to me in my last flight, was inedible. Malaysian and Thai airways food, was more enjoyable. Cutting cost on food that is served
that costs minimal amounts of money is not the way to retain customers. Deplorable",June 2023,2,2,1,4,2,3,4,1
1,"Qantas, don''t care about their passengers","Flight was on time, luggage arrived 3 days later.
Interestingly each time we went to the airport to get an update there were other travelers from other flights who had had the same experience. One poor guy had been waiting for over a week for his luggage.
Flight back, my inflight entertainment system was not working, same for the passenger beside me and the passenger in front of them.
Given the rampant and justified slagging off of Qantas in recent times it highlights how out of touch their board members are giving an outgoing CEO a $10 million bonus when they are losing money and getting nothing but bad press. Avoid flying Qantas and if you have to have tracking devices on your bags and multiple name tags.
Planning to go to Japan next year, but certainly will not be flying with Qantas (or Jetstar).",September 2023,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,It will be my first and last to fly Qantas,"I travel a lot and has flown with different airlines from all over the world and Qantas is the worst so far in terms of food, baggage allowance and customer service.
They have stingy baggage allowance, I had an economy ticket and I was shocked to learn that I'm only allowed ONE checked-in luggage for an INTERNATIONAL flight as opposed to the usual 2 with other airlines.
When we landed at Sydney airport, we couldn't disembark as there was another plane that had a mechanical issue and so we we're stuck at the runway for a few hours which would have been ok with me personally since things happen but the way the crew handled the passengers who are now at risk for missing their connecting flights is downright bad customer service. One time I flew with United Airlines and it had a delayed flight due to bad weather and as soon as the plane landed, the crew announced via PA that some passengers have a tight connecting flight and proceeded to ask these passengers to identify themselves by raising their hands and then told the rest of us to let them disembark first. A few people, myself included talked to the flight attendant at Qantas and voiced my concern about possibly missing my connecting flight (and I supposedly had a 3-hour layover at Sydney) but they did nothing. No announcements of some sort. Lesson learned, I will never fly Qantas again.",August 2023,2,2,2,1,1,2,3,2
5,Best airline in the world by far.,"Very comfortable flight and very generous food and refreshments and far better than other airlines that I have recently travelled on, including Singapore Airlines and Garuda.

1,Never Again!,"Trip from Johannesburg to NZ was ok.

Trip from Auckland to Johannesburg was a nightmare and the worst airline I have flown!! The most horrendous experience from airport security, boarding in Sydney to landing in Johannesburg.

Getting off the plane from Auckland in Sydney, you walked into a wall of people because customs electronic booths is at the door when you deplane. You had to walk through the mass of people to get to security and there was only 1 security booth open for all international transit passengers!!

I have never experienced a “quiet terminal” in any airport before!! The gate had multiple flights going out of gate 26.A-G. There was 1 long line to queue up. The only way you knew if they were ready to board your flight was this tiny little voice (without a loudspeaker/intercom) that would make an announcement. I’m not sure if this is an Australian method showing how to manage chaos, teach tired, frazzled, nervous travelers tolerance and patience or to deter them from ever flying Qantas again!!

On the plane, food and service was subpar for business class. They served 2 meals and both meals selection was the same. They could not even bother to add variety! Never have I experienced this on any airline. Not only that, they proceeded to tell me that they had run out of selections and I was limited to 2 choices. One choice I had the previous meal which was dry fish. I asked for a coffee during the flight - which I never received until I asked again.

Besides the Asian lady attendant and Jarrod, I found all other attendants, rude and arrogant. I wish I had gotten the name of the thin blond attendant - not sure what I did to her but the animosity that oozed out of her was palatable and quite unnerving. if I read her expression wrong, a smile would have made a difference. There was absolutely no service during the flight.

Needless to say if I have a choice, I would not fly Qantas again. I would take the longer flight!!",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,Very impressed!,"Despite the flack that Qantas has received recently, I couldn't be more appreciative of the service I received today on QF770. Wonderful service, friendly and efficient and loved the soh! Thanks to all.",September 2023,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,4
1,Qantas suck,Double booking jointly as a couple for four flights paid jointly. Two flights we had to get them to change seats to be together and third flight seperated. There computer software setup sucks that it doesnt recognize a double booking then the grief one goes through to get them reseated. Pathetic service. Never fly them again,August 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,OK for domestic business class.,"This was the second leg of my flights from Hobart to Perth via Melbourne. I enjoyed the business lounge in Melbourne and then boarded the A330 to Perth. The seat was good overall but the interiors of the planes are getting tatty and old. The movie system was also broken but there was free WiFi. The food was good and plentiful but as is often now the Qantas way, the flight attendants just disappeared mid-flight never to be seen again until landing... A good use of points but not really good value if you are paying cash.",September 2023,5,4,1,3,3,3,4,4
5,Qantas is Amazing!,"I flew on Qantas last month from Canberra to Perth and it was an amazing flight! I really liked the service and seats in the plane, the flight attendants were very kind, and I loved how there was a bunch of leg space in the cabin. The restrooms were clean! I highly recommend Qantas!",August 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
1,Inaccurate information and no care given,"Qantas recently cancelled 3 flights for a full day from Devonport, Tas, airport, to Melbourne, due to low cloud.
No low cloud or particularly bad weather apparent to me, but presumably they know more than me. They can't control weather - but they can control how they deal with it.

Fortunately I was on the 5.10pm flight, others had been waiting since 9am for the 10am flight. They were angry.

We did not get sms messages. I was told at the counter that they don't do that, as some people don't have Australian mobiles! Well, some (most) do! How about calling those that do? Qantas keeps the numbers on record. They could try.

They could send them hours later with INACCURATE information twice!

Qantas did get me and others, not sure if all, on a flight out of Launceston that night. They provided a bus that evening for the flight out to Melbourne.

The issues were:
1. They didn't even try to let people know by sms or calls BEFORE the flight. I want to know before arriving at the airport. I had a friend visit at the airport, by chance, and she took me to L'ton - she could have saved my brother a trip to the D'port airport had I had a simple sms.

2. They seemed to have no idea what was happening. I got an sms at 6.45pm as I was about to board the Launceston flight, telling me the D'port flight had been cancelled and I could not take it.
I got a second sms in Melbourne as I was waiting for my connecting flight to Perth. The Perth flight was making the boarding call. The sms said the flight from Devonport was not going and I could not be rescheduled, could not take a flight and to contact their office.
About 5 hours earlier I had been told at Devonport counter that I was on a Jetstar flight to Perth instead about 11pm, which I was! I was not long after about to board it!
The one side sending out these sms messages - showing they could actually send messages - seemed to have NO idea what was happening.

2. They offered a food voucher for $15 at Launceston airport. Seemed fine to me, till I saw you could not get a basic meal, e.g. salad and drink, for $15. Some people had been waiting all day. One small, basic salad was $15.

3. I had booked and paid for a Qantas flight not a Jetstar flight from Melbourne to Perth. I was then on Jetstar, and arrived about 3 hours later than scheduled flight.
Luckily a friend could collect me in the middle of the night!
I should have been given:
a. choice to stay overnight in Melbourne (I am over 60)
b. taxi voucher for Perth airport - why should my friend, over 70, have to come out to get me at 1.10am?
c. voucher for food on Jetstar. You pay for drinks and food on Jetstar. I had had 2 pieces of cake at L'ton airport, as that was what voucher bought me, and had expected a meal on the flight to Perth, which I had in effect paid for with my QF ticket booking. Instead I got no drink or food for 4 hours.
d. same seat booking - instead of the window seat I had booked on QF, I was in a middle seat, next to someone who was clearly sick and coughing all the way, for 4 hours, with no entertainment on Jetstar but to listen to him coughing!

4. Another Sydney flight was held for the connecting flight. Mine to Perth was not. When I got off the L'ton flight, the Perth flight I was booked on was a 1-minute walk away. With foresight, D'port staff could have put my bag at the front of the plane and let me collect it on the tarmac and I could have got my connecting flight easily. These are small planes and it is possible. The Perth flight was not even boarding when I went past the counter, which was right where I landed from L'ton. I had plenty of time to collect my bag and still go back up there - and the counter for luggage was manned but they would not do it. It just required foresight - putting the passenger's needs first.

5. There was an announcement on the plane about accommodation in Melbourne. I had asked in D'port if I could stay over in Melbourne and was told I could not - instead I could arrive at 1.10am in Perth and rely on a 71-year-old friend to collect me at that hour, far later than 10.20pm.

No foresight, no thought, no care, no respect is how I would sum up Qantas's service.

This was after sitting on the most cramped seat I have sat on from Hong Kong to Melbourne a month before on a Qantas flight too. I have never had less space - including on AirAsia or other no frills airlines.

I wrote to Qantas about the D'port issue but the reply was of no help.

If I have a choice, I won't fly Qantas.",August 2023,1,2,1,1,1,5,1,1
5,Super Comfy & Great Service,"We enjoyed a 2 week vacation in Australia and flew Air Canada YYZ - LAX - then Qantas to SYD. All in business class. The AC flight was shocking An aging old plane with moldy crummy J class seats and lackluster service with mediocre food. By contrast the Qantas flight was fantastic. Lie flat beds, extraordinary kind and enthusiastic attendants and even a ""lounge"" in the upper deck of the plane to sit, relax and have a drink or food. Qantas is not known for fine cuisine but the food was quite tasty and generous, Above all - the happy staff, kindness and enthusiasm were a tonic. Highly recommend this well priced business product. A comfortable and easy way to make this arduous trip.",September 2023,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5
1,"Lost Baggage, Terrible Communication","The flight itself was fine and the flight attendants were great, etc. The reason for this review is the grossly mishandled baggage. I was on a direct flight from JFK to Auckland and they never put my bag on the flight. It was an oversized and unique looking snowboard bag containing over $5,000 usd of equipment. When I landed, I filed a report with the airport. I didn't receive an update for 3 days; the baggage was just missing. When they finally located the baggage (they didn't notify me), I checked and it was confirmed to be on the next series of flights JFK to Auckland and then to Queenstown. Well I called after the expected landing in Queenstown (Again they did not reach out to me) and they said it never arrived. They could not confirm with me what flight they intended to put it on after the secondary mess up. Finally, I checked online again and they planned to put it on an afternoon flight the next day. They called my hostel in the morning asking if I planned to pick it up, and I said no, they would need to deliver it. They said they would deliver it that afternoon. I got back to my accommodation and they did not deliver it, again with no phone call or confirmation or anything. Just no snowboard bag. I'm not in a financial position to front unlimited money to rent or replace the gear from my bag (again over $5,000usd worth of equipment). Qantas's lack of competency and inability to communicate has extremely negatively impacted my trip and I would not recommend booking with them unless you are able to take a trip where you rely solely on carry on baggage.",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Terrible Qantas,"Just terrible! There’s not enough room to note down all the issues started with the booking system online - ending with terrible customer service and support! Avoid this Arline if you can, should something go wrong, they will not support you.",September 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
4,Sound business class domestic flight,I flew from Hobart to Perth via Melbourne and this was the first sector. I had redeemed points to fly business class. The seat on the 717 is comfortable and I had seat 2A. Some of the seat edges are looking tired and the tablet holder was broken. The meal service was tasty but too slow on this short flight so it felt rushed. They could have started serving much sooner. The Hobart Qantas club is over crowded as usual!,September 2023,5,5,4,3,3,2,5,4
4,Good Service Rattly Old Plane,The A330 200 we were on was old missing paint and everything squeaked and rattled. I would expect this of Air India not Qantas. The crew however were great no doubt glad to be rid of Alan Joyce and the food excellent. It was late leaving due to “the late arrival “ of the aircraft which was at the gate the whole time!!!!,September 2023,2,2,2,5,4,4,4,5
3,Excellent Cabin crew and in flight service marred by 6HR delay in take off,"Our flight on 24 August was delayed for 6 hours, with advices only received whilst on the way to the airport at 730AM. This resulted in arriving in JHB at about 10PM. This impacted on a connecting flight. Apart from this the flight was without incident and the cabin crew (and ground staff at check in) was very friendly and efficient. This part of the service could not be faulted.",August 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
1,Qantas as usual TERRIBLE,"As usual Qantas and its staff have learnt nothing. Late flight, being ""warned"" that my luggage was over weight by 160grams YES 160 grams !!!!. And told not to do it again.

I have already banned myself for life to EVER fly qantas international - wish I could for domestic but unfortunately the convenience means I cant.

Etihad, Singapore, Qatar - get my dollars every time.

BTW: I am a qantas platinum flier which these days means nothing to Qantas",September 2023,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,3
5,Very caring Qantas Personnel,"After having a medical issue mid flight between Melbourne and Sydney the attention and assistance that I was given was excellent with airline personnel organised an ambulance and paramedics to collect me from the plane,

1,"Qantas lost my bag on the 1st flight, collected next day damaged and my next flight home was delayed!","I booked all my flight with Qantas. Jhb to Sydney and Sydney to Good Coast and return.

Arrived at Sydney and checked in for my next flight to Gold Coast.

Arrived at OOL an the couldn’t find my checked in bag.

I had no choice but to buy clothes and toiletries… ended up going back the next day to collect my bag at OOL (nobody called to say it arrived) , got my bag with a damaged / melted wheel and couldn’t pull my bag for the rest of the trip.

My return flight to Sydney was Delayed and luckily i was able to make my connecting flight back to Jhb.

This was such an unpleasant trip. The service is really good on the air crafts but i’ll rather book my next trip to Aus via Singapore Airlines.",August 2023,3,3,5,5,2,5,4,5
1,Qantas - NEVER AGAIN!,"I have been a Gold FF for many years and have travelled extensively with Qantas. Never again. Over the last few years the service and attitude of staff has declined rapidly, yet I persisted. On 25th August I was flying from Sydney to LA and after a 6 hour delay (causing me to miss the first event I was due to attend as a result), I arrived to find they had lost my bag. It was clearly labelled, but still got lost. As a result I land on the other side of the world with nothing but the clothes on my back. 3 days later it arrives. in the meantime I have spent $380 on essentials and clothes, none of which they would reimburse. As I was travelling a lot, I also managed to get gold with Virgin, even though my loyalty was with Qantas, however, I can honestly say, I will never fly Qantas again...EVER! Take it from me, Virgin are by far the superior service and now have my loyalty as a traveler.",August 2023,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
1,Qantas wants your money,"BEWARE if you cancel within 24 hours of booking your flight you DO NOT GET A REFUND!!!
You will receive a refund for taxes paid, but not the flight. Refunds only occur on US flights!!!",September 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Sadness for a company that once was great,I remember the Qantas before AJ destroyed it. When Qantas club served better than shopping mall standard food. When flights being on time mattered. When staff and customers matter. Here's hoping the stench of the current board fades away soon.,July 2023,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,2
1,"Qantas business class, no entertainment, awful food, dirty seats","Business class does not have any entertainment of any kind. Not even radio! Seats and over way tray were dirty and it was the first flight for the morning! No charge outlets for devices. No WI-FI so nothing to do on the flight if you haven't a book to read. Food tasted awful, cummin and tumeric flavours for breakfast! Disgusting!

So I get sat a the back of the next flight, no hot left for passengers at the back.",August 2023,1,2,3,1,1,3,1,1
3,Way below international food standard,"Having flown Qantas extensively over 30 years I've always been a staunch supporter however this most recent flight was a bit disappointing. Cabin Service was OK, seating and legroom were fine, cleanliness was good. The food however was way below standard and I can only describe the dinner as tadteless mush. Never expect fine dining on an aircraft but the food was dismal.",August 2023,4,4,4,4,3,3,4,1
5,An Incredible Pleasant Suprise,"Have flown all over the world with most international carries. Have always avoided Qantas as it is expensive and I hear mixed feedback.
Out of necessity of timing, booked this flight to BKK.
First disappointment was automated check in without enough people around to assist with questions. Especially as I wanted a fragle sticker for my luggage but was unable to get one. I also wanted to request emergency exit seat and though I had done so, until I board and have a middle seat (of a row of 4) in the center section, even though I requested Window and Bulkhead.
VERY Annoyed.
However, Qantas displayed the levels of hospitality that I noice are missing from all parts of hospitality in Australian culture now. The greeting stepping on board was wam and genuine, the assistance in finding my seat was convivial, and one crew member by the name of Shannon was a pure joy to watch interact with everyone, Not tongue in cheek, sarcasm or eye rolls. Just professional and properly old school courteous to all. I can not highlight the impact she had on all those that interacted with her. I believe the same. was true for many others in he crew, ut Shannon was he one I could see. Kudos to her, she saved the trip for me, hands down.
OH, and the other amazing thing, I had a row of 4 of which I was in the middle, but by time of takeoff, no one else joined the row, so I go to stretch out acoss 4 seats without an issue, and sle through meal services (of course Shannon returned with mine later.

Qantas... you are good, your people make you great, and that makes me nostalgic for the days of Australian Hospitality being a leader in the world, which Qantas is holding the banner for the rest of us. Well done.",August 2023,3,4,5,5,5,5,3,4
1,Overall bad management without explanation why the flight was late and delayed,"Flew last week and had a connecting flight at international terminal Sydney. An hour before checkin time my flight was delayed three times. I called the QANTAS helpline and the person wasn’t helpful, and answered none of the questions I was asking. Received illusive answers that made no sense. I was told it’ll be fine and to ask a flight attendant when we got to Sydney and put me on a flight that was late by 25mins, Which left 10mins to get through customs and across to international sector, and to my gate across the opposite side of the terminal. There was 0 explanation about delays. Ended up with a 22.5hr layover and which waited 5 hours to even board the rescheduled flight. This is the second time in 8 months this has happened. I lost a full two days of my international travel which was expensive. Lost time with family and friends due to Qantas negligence. If flying to New Zealand. Go through air NZ. Far more worth your money!!!",July 2023,3,3,3,2,2,3,1,3
5,Great crew at airport and onboard.,"I flew premium economy as I am an older person and cannot sit in economy for such a long flight. I took advantage of Qantas's generous on board allowance and travelled with only hand luggage. The flights and layover in Singapore were seamless. Crew on all four flights were amazing and very friendly and helpful, particularly the crew out of Heathrow. I ordered vegan meals and was happy with all of them except for the breakfast out of Singapore which was some sort of sweet white bread with milk and jam. Unfortunately what was an affordable option has now gone up considerably, so I will be flying with another airline for my trip to London in December.",September 2022,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4
4,A great flight with no problems t,This short flight to Sydney was just over an hour in duration. Easy online check in with a short wait for bag drop. The crew were pleasant and friendly and the meal service was fine. Free high speed wifi on this flight was a nice surprise and allowed this review to be written and posted while in the air.,August 2023,4,4,-1,4,5,5,4,4
1,Awful. Avoid,"Checking in. Told the girl we would miss our connecting flight due to the 5 hour delay. She only went and cancelled it. Spent over an hour and a half waiting for her to sort it out. Then told the only flight she could get us back on from Heathrow would be 8.30pm. We arrived at Heathrow at 10am so would have to sit around all day. Had no other choice. The 17 hour flight was mainly in darkness. Only had lights on when eating the disgusting food on offer. The staff on board need training on customer service. There is no need to ask me my nationality. Some were rude but thought they were funny. Very unprofessional and everything too much trouble. Snacks and drinks were few and far between. My husband - not sat with me- was not offered any. If you wanted anything you had to go to the back of the plane and ask. I did this and someone else came for some water. The hostess said she was trying to have a 10 min break. She huffed, picked up the phone and asked for the seatbelt sign to go on as it was bumpy. It wasn't bumpy she just couldn't be bothered. We were then told we had to go to our seats. 2 mins later the seatbelt sign went off. Difficult to get back up when sat in the middle of 2 strangers. Food came and then they forgot to clear the dirty items away on the row I was sat on so had to put my light on and tell them. The windows have a purple tint so you can't see out. Only when coming into land did the windows clear for you to see. Why travel in the dark for so long!! Won't use again and don't recommend.",August 2023,3,2,3,1,2,3,1,1
1,Overloaded Flight,"Much mayhem at Queenstown Airport when Qantas was running an hour late before any announcement was made. Every other flight left on time. Finally, Qantas made an announcement to say that the Brisbane flight would be diverted to Christchurch as there was not enough fuel (and too much baggage) to make it over the Southern Alps and back to Brisbane in one go! Not good. Once we had re-fuelled at Christchurch and finally landed in Brisbane it had been a 9 hour journey (usually 4 at most). The flight crew were rude, dismissive and unprofessional. Many passengers would have missed their connecting flights. The captain did a good job under the circumstances, but the whole thing was scary and didn't really instill much faith. Food was disgusting. I have since vowed to never, ever, fly Qantas again if I can help it. Goodbye Qantas. You were once great. Not any more.",July 2023,4,4,3,1,3,3,1,1
3,Same Chicken Salad,"This was the last leg of my journey to visit Tokyo. I should have been on the previous flight, but changed to this one, as the Haneda-Melbourne flight was delayed one hour. Onboard menu was the same as before. For some reason they don't serve hot chicken dish, but beef or pork. So I had a chicken salad, which was OK. As a wheel of my luggage was damaged in Melbourne, I reported in Adelaide and was repaired by Qantas. Thank you!",July 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Why we will never fly with Qantas again,"We (wife, 1 year old daughter and I) had our flight from Adelaide to Sydney delayed then cancelled due to 'staff sickness', we were shifted to another flight 4 hours later, was assured by staff that they were adjusting flight times so we would not miss our connecting international flight to Tokyo (which we later discovered was false information). Replacement flight was delayed (because, Qantas), but we were told that they were taking care of it. It was only until we were about to depart that we learnt via email that we would have to stay overnight in Sydney for a flight the next day. We got to Sydney and the email link told us there were no rooms available. So around an hour at Qantas service kiosk they booked us into another hotel. It's worth mentioning that none of the Qantas staff seem to have any idea what was happening or what to do. There was an elderly Japanese couple with us that we were assisting along the way, with my wife interpreting everything for them. We finally got a hotel booking and went to claim our checked in luggage (that was meant to go to Tokyo) and were given a number to a 24 hr shuttle bus that went straight to voicemail. This was around 10.30pm with 1 year old and an ederly Japanese couple who we were assisting along the way (because Qantas certainly couldn't help them), who spoke little english and were just trying to get home. At this point I was genuinely concerned however managed purely by chance of bumping into staff we preciously spoke to who gave us some taxi vouchers. The taxi driver tried to rip us off and demanded an additional $10 cash on top of $80 worth of cab vouchers for a 10min commute to the hotel. At the hotel, a massive cue of exhausted people in similar situation welcomed us. I asked hotel staff to provide water to us and the elderly couple while waiting, before checking in at 11pm. We were booked in on a flight at 6.30am the next morning (to Melbourne!?). The next morning we got up at 3.30am (3 hours sleep) to get shuttle but to drop us at Sydney Airport for flight to Melbourne for a connection to Tokyo. We were dropped off at wrong terminal (I made it clear where we were going and our situation) only to learn check in is closed until 5am so we had to get a taxi to domestic (this was at around 4.30am, wandering around Sydney airport carpark with a 1 year old and luggage). Taxi driver again tried to rip us off, ensuring we paid per person. Taxi van (only one they had that had a baby seat), smelt of urine and the driver swore at every car on road. Arrived at our domestic for flight to Melbourne. Amazingly, and a first for us with Qantas, was that this flight was not delayed, presumably due to an early morning flight with business commuters. We arrive in Melbourne and proceded to international terminal for flight to Tokyo, flight delayed 40mins. Arrive in Tokyo, flight held on tarmac. All with a one year old (who was amazingly well behaved throughtout despite being exhausted). No, I'm not making this up - this actually happened.

Absolutely disgusted in the way we were treated and I'm embarrassed and sad to see what Qantas has become. It was genuinely like being in a third world country, being herded like cattle. Our compensation for the ordeal was a $20 meal voucher. We fly to Japan every year, but from now on will be doing everything we can to use an alternative airline, no matter the cost. Seriously, just pay a little more and fly with someone else.",July 2023,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
1,Delayed every time,I flew with Qantas once in July and once in August. The flights were delayed for mechanical reasons on both occasions. My onward flights were missed on both occasions.,August 2023,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,1
1,Have lost all care for customers,"Be wary of booking with Qantas as they are not the customer service driven airline they once were.

Took two days to change a spelling error on a flight booking.
Then would not add a luggage allowance or meals onto a JQ flight when processing a flight change from a QF flight to a JQ flight when the QF flight was $300 more expensive per ticket.
Requested to talk to a manager about the issue and the staff in the Philippines have had me on hold for over 1.15 mins.

Be wary of booking with Qantas as they are not the customer service driven airline they once were. We had paid for extra leg room seats for our long haul flights and have been disgusted to find Qantas have resold those seats on our return flight to other passengers. We only found out by chance when logging into ‘manage my booking’. We phoned them thinking they would rectify the situation without any fuss but they did nothing except offer an apology over the phone, like that’s going to help an over 6 foot person who will now be squashed when they paid an extra fee almost a year in advance to secure a legroom seat. We then had to request the refund of the initial payment - did Qantas think they could keep the money??

1,Absolute shambles,"Arrived an hour early for Melbourne to Sydney flight at the advertised gate 23. Twenty minutes later I noticed a queue ready for boarding behind me, but no staff member. I checked the noticeboard to find our flight was now going from gate 3 ( no announcement had been made). I told others sitting near me to check the departures board and move to gate 3. Everyone did. Still half an hour to boarding. I went to the toilet near gate 3 and glanced at the departures board again. Now it said we were leaving from gate 21 !! I went back to gate 21 and made an announcement to all - the gate has changed again. Everyone was thanking me as we made our way back to 21. I was the first there and noticed 2 Qantas staff members by the gate. I thanked them for being there for our flight 468. One of them looked confused and got on the mobile phone. Turns out they had been sent to the wrong gate themselves and they quickly departed. Can you believe that !! 5 minutes after our boarding time, a Qantas rep arrived and announced our flight would be delayed, No mention of how long it would be overdue. People are racing up to the desk to say they had connecting flights in Sydney ,and how long was the wait going to be. Absolute chaos.",August 2023,3,3,1,1,1,3,1,3
2,Strange breakfast,"Whiile in Tokyo around 4pm I received a text message about the delay. I also received an email to rebook the connecting flight to Adelaide. But when we were onboard it was not explained the reason for delay. Worst of all one of the two toilets for Business class was out of order! They should have fixed it before it took off. I had a Japanese dinner, but it wasn't nice as the ones I ate in town. They had a strange choice of breakfast. I had avocado, roasted tomato and soft boiled egg on sourdough toast. But avocado wasn’t fresh, but a paste, and the egg wasn’t boiled but porched - very soft and runny. Does Neil Perry like to eat a mushy mixture of runny egg yolk and avocado paste for breakfast?",August 2023,-1,-1,-1,4,3,5,5,2

1,"Shame on you, Qantas.","I can't believe the level of incompetence and disregard I've experienced with Qantas. My recent trip with this airline turned into an absolute nightmare thanks to their delays, mismanagement, and lack of customer service.

First, my flight was delayed by an absurd 30 hours, causing me to miss a significant family event that I had traveled for. But that was just the beginning of the ordeal. My luggage went missing for a mind-boggling 14 days, leaving me without essentials and causing major inconvenience.

What's even more infuriating is the way their customer service handled the situation. Empty promises, vague responses, and a complete lack of urgency were the norm. It's as if they think it's acceptable to treat their customers like dirt.

Qantas has proven that they have zero respect for their customers and their comfort. This airline has turned my vacation into a stressful and embarrassing mess. I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.

Do yourself a favor and avoid Qantas at all costs. They're a prime example of a company that cares more about profits than about the well-being of their customers. I will never, ever fly with them again after this ordeal.

Shame on you, Qantas. You've lost a customer for life.",August 2023,2,3,4,1,1,3,1,4

World

Be aware - no Dubai connect service with qantas even if it is advertised in their website

909878113

I booked my ticket with Qantas via expedia. On my way back I selected a qantas flight operated by Emirates with a long layover (10hrs) because I had no other option on this day . I was aware that Emirates offers a free layover hotel night if the layover is longer than 8 hours in partnership with Qantas, as stated in Qantas and Emirates's websites :

I was eligible for it, As I had a Qantas ticket operated by emirates and the ticket had to be booked through a third party, which I did.

I selected it and paid for it. I qualified for all the criterias (long layover, ok share flight number, ok number of economy class letter...)

15 days before departure, I called Qantas to get this booked. They told me to contact Emirates. Emirates told me that this is Qantas that has to take care of this. Later, Qantas told me to contact Expedia. Expedia contacted twice with Qantas and Emirates. None of the companies were cooperative and could help them. Qantas told expedia to contact Emirates... The issue is that apparently dubai connect service was not appearing in my ticket although I was eligible for it.

I spent about 6 hours in total with all of them. And none where capable of provide the service or even explain to me why I was not eligible...

I have been also told twice by Emirates that the partnership had ended in March 2023 a few week after I booked.

At the end, qantas told me to sort this out in the airport in dubai at the dubai connect counter. And of course, when I arrived they could not help me... They told me qantas is the one that should have organised it. There was no qantas office in dubai.

I was 4.5months pregnant, the only option left was to book a US$150 night at the airport which I did not. Super disappointed and even more disappointed that to this day, i still don't have any explanation why I did not get the service and how I could have prevented that from happening.

I am still asking for the reason why I did not get the service and Qantas is not even answering anymore my emails.

Conclusion: don't expect any dubai connect service from Qantas. Still advertise in their website but you won't get anything.",July 2023,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,1

1,"Forced to pay twice for a ticket, no refund, was lied to by Qantas. Pathetic excuse for an airline!","I've travelled Qantas for many years and they have definitely gone downhill in the last few years.

Had to add a young child on to our ticket for international travel to Sth America. Paid the extra fee, received the 'ticket' by email. So far so good.

We get to the airport, and are told by the co-share airline that the ticket issued by Qantas was not valid. Spent over an hour at the check-in desk, nearly missing our flight while they had to come up with a highly convoluted solution to get around Qantas' negligence. This is after spending many hours on the phone sorting out the ticket in the first place (average wait time: 4hours).

While in Sth America spent hours on the phone and email trying to avoid the same situation happening on the way back. Was repeatedly told over the phone that the ticket was fine and our son would definitely get on the flight no problem.

But guess what? On the way back home the same thing happened! This time at a foreign airport where Qantas has no reps at all. Again we nearly missed our flight after spending more than an hour at check-in. The outcome was we had to pay AGAIN to the co-share airline for a ticket we had already paid for because the ticket Qantas sent us was INVALID according to the co share airline.

After complaining to Qantas, weeks later receive a response saying that the ticket had not been issued because the payment hadn't gone through - even though we had receive a receipt for our payment and a confirmation of the ticket being issued from Qantas! Lies and more lies from a useless, incompetent airline that has received millions in bailout money from the Australian government. We still haven't got a refund!

During an estimated 25 hours of phone calls or wait time, never spoke to an Australian or anyone who works directly for Qantas. This company outsources all its communication to Asian call centres so that they never have to actually deal with customers or solve any issues themselves. No offence to the lovely call centre workers of the Philippines, who are probably paid very little for their time and don't seem to have adequate training or support to deal with airline bookings and queries.

Qanta is living proof that corporate bailouts are a bad idea and the rusting hulk of Qantas should have been left to die a natural death.",October 2022,2,2,1,3,1,3,1,3

Seems funny how it was ok to fly the A380 out of London without a problem but it was a issue once it was in Singapore? Fussy change over Captain maybe?? The flight crew / staff on this leg of the QF2 flight were absolute rubbish and had no customer service experience which I’m used to on Qantas flights. The Aussie crew out of SIN must have been newbies? Can’t really complain about the service cause there wasn’t any!!!! Sad to see what was once a great airline go to s*#t.

1,Literally the worst airline of all time,"Absolute disgrace of an airline. Avoid at all costs.
From the company that pushed the idea of the Nazi Vcn passports with their government chorines and destroyed the whole aviation industry in Australia, funny to watch them now they know they have the monopoly and can offer the worst possible service imaginable. If delayed and canceled flights are your thing, staff that put zero effort in to help you connect to your next flight after they make you go though immigration before your connecting flight, planes from the 1930s that could pass as Fred Flintstones car with wings and zero overhead room for your bags as they cancel half filled flights and pack out the planes till there is not one spare seat. If that’s your thing then it’s a great airline. Oh and they have also jacked the economy ticket price to basically match what once would have been business class prices.
Luckily though if you need to charge your devices, they have USB charging points that don’t work.
Really loved watching the criminal cartel AKA, the Australian government, pour billions of our tax dollars into bailing out this woeful company time after time. Nice to see them bailed out after the deliberate destruction of every small business in the country over the last 3 years.
The one saving grace is the free Wi-Fi to allow you to leave them the review they deserve.",August 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Unorganized mess,Terrible airline! Kept us well informed of why we were delayed. They didn’t pull the plane out of the hanger until our departure time then stated “lost the cargo net” that holds the luggage in place. Can’t seem to get it together. Delayed flight over an hour where I missed my connection to my final destination. Very poor performance today,July 2023,2,1,1,5,1,3,3,1
2,Not the trip of a lifetime I was expecting!,On QF82. Flight delayed due to ill passenger. Fully understand why the flight was diverted to Adelaide. However communication about the diversion was diabolical not told about it until the very last minute and flight took over 10 hours with only one meal and one extra cup of coffee. Promised food vouchers but they never appeared! To compare a 12hr flight from London to Singapore we got three different meals. Could have looked after us a lot better. Hope the person is feeling better.,August 2023,3,3,2,1,2,3,4,1
1,"Avoid Qantas, awful to deal with when they mess up and you are out $700.","Qantas is the worst airline I have ever dealt with, bar none.

Our flight, QF103, was scheduled to depart Sydney NSW to Honolulu, Hi on the evening of July 27, 2023. We were then set to go through Honolulu to LAX on American Airlines on the morning of July 28, 2023. We had two Qantas booking numbers and paid for five seats, one adult with each booking number and our 3 minor children listed 2 on a booking with an adult and 1 on the other.

We arrived a few hours early, checked bags, went through customs, exchanged the last of our AU$ for US$, and ultimately boarded about 30 minutes after the scheduled loading time. Apparently the plane was suffering from a ""technical issue"" prior to boarding, and now the flight was delayed. We were seated, and they kept us sitting on the plane for nearly three hours. That was so long it meant that no flights could now take off, because the 2300 SYD airport curfew went into effect. Qantas knew this, this is their primary airport!

Qantas returned us to the gate, had us go back through customs after retrieving our baggage and put 250+/- people out into the cold after midnight (remember, July is winter in Sydney!). They provided cab fare cards and told us all verbally at the gate that they would reimburse $300AU for hotels and $50AU per person for food. Naturally this was done with no taxi cabs outside because the airport was closed, and no local hotels put on notice that a slew of people would be trying to find lodging. It became a total free for all to find a cab that would take 5 people and a hotel with an available room. Somehow we found rooms and a cabbie willing to take us, and it took us until nearly 0200 to get to the airport Holiday Inn and check in. (2.5 hours after we returned to the gate.)

That day we were initially sent an e-mail from Qantas when we filed a complaint. In this e-mail from Qantas they were again offering to reimburse hotel rooms at $300 AU and meals $50AU per person, which is exactly what we were told at the gate. Now, we had to book two rooms because they would not accept 5 staying in one, and we got the last two available rooms at the Holiday Inn Sydney airport, so these last minute bookings were $294 AU per room out of our pocket for one night.

We took another cab to the airport early the next day trying to get a seat on a flight to LAX. We had to be bussed to the domestic terminal, wait two hours to fly from Sydney to Brisbane, sit in the Brisbane airport from 1400-2100, and then catch a direct 14+ hour flight flight to LAX. At the Brisbane airport, we spent a total of $190.00 for 5 people for food. This was our grand total for eating at the airport for the 24 hour period after the flight was cancelled.

Two days later, Qantas sent an e mail offering a max reimbursement of $250.00 AU total. I responded directly to their ""customer care"" e-mail and sent them copies of their initial e-mails offering $300AU, all hotel and food receipts, etc. Instead of responding they, closed both of our claims. I have now e-mailed 4x and called ""customer service"" here 2x, with no response. Qantas refuses to provide a ""customer care"" telephone number, and hides behind e-mails when you have an issue.

I will never again fly Qantas, I do not trust them to stick to their words at all. I strongly recommend everyone avoid this airline at all costs. Caveat Emptor, spend your money on airfare elsewhere.",July 2023,4,4,2,1,1,4,1,3
1,Totally feel cheated and did not get any compassion from Qantas,"I had booked to holiday with my 90 year old Mum for June. I got a phone call to say my Mum had a large brain aneurysm on 31st May. I rang Qantas that afternoon to change flight. I have mobility issues and my beautiful Mum had originally paid over $5,000 for me to to travel business class. I rang qantas 31/4/23 to change flights. It took me about 1/2 an hr to do it because (a) I could not understand foreign speaking gentleman and (b) he kept making mistakes. Finally booked flight one way which cost me $1,600. I was so shocked. My Mum passed away a month later. I booked my flight back back to Perth which cost me $600. So the total trip Perth to Coffs Harbour return was over $7,200 business class. Mind you Sydney to Coffs return was economy. The return flight from Perth was in an old plane with cracked leather seats and very uncomfortable. In Sydney I had to walk down stairs from plane and then across tarmac and up 3 flights of stairs. I complained to Qantas as i expected more compassion for my circumstances
All I was given was 6 000 Qantas points for my circumstances. The return trip was a nightmare for me. $7,200 for a return trip within Australia is ludicrous. I dont think I have any recourse on this. I feel so cheated by Qantas and feel me dear Mother has been cheated also.",May 2023,4,2,4,1,1,3,5,5
3,DISSAPOINTED IN SERVICE IN ALL AREAS,"The plane was dirty and the toilets were absolutely filthy before we had even left ON OUR 14 + Hour flight. The toilets ran out of water to wash our hands. By the end of the flight the entire plane was a mess. Add to that, my suitcase got lost and neither QANTAS or American Airlines helped me in any way. The baggage serivce staff in Sydney told me I had to wait until I arrived in Melbourne. The staff in Melbourne told me it had to be done in Sydney and even suggested I fly back there to lodge a lost luggage report. Ridiculous. Then when I phoned, both companies couldn't have cared less. Very dissapointed.",August 2023,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,2

Unfriendly typical qantas service on flight. Departing London they couldn't find my booking and not interested in helping, told me to contact Australia.

Assumed, given a 13:10 flight, I'd be fed lunch. But the only thing (apart from small bags of crisps) on offer was Sandwiches. Apparently they do NOT do Gluten free on short flights. Which, while disappointing, would have been fine had I KNOWN about it. A little message popping up after I had made the selection, perhaps?

2,Worse than Qatar Economy,"Others have written about poor quality of the flight accessories (see Sydney Morning Herald). In our case it was the service that was substandard and offered with a feeling of someone doing a boring and unpleaant task. They were old men, obviously no longer interested in the job. I had to ask for everything, few services were ended as quickly as possible. We continued to Rome with Qatar Economy and received much better and cheerful service. I regret having to criticise a once great airline but Joyce/Albanese link did no good. May be now the 23-year old Albanese son on the Qantas Chairmans Lounge will improve the service?",May 2023,4,3,2,1,2,3,3,3
1,LOST BAGGAGE,"Qantas, “the pride of Australia, our National Carrier” they say.
I say “shameful and not up to any Australian standard”.

In comparison to other flights, Qantas surely lacks standards in terms of ground staff service, onboard meals, taking accountability and ensuring that no hiccups of any sort, is repeated. They should learn from their mistakes and value their patrons for without air passengers, Qantas cannot promote themselves. They surely need to upgrade their understanding of service.

If one should go through the reviews of Qantas on several websites, one would read about delayed or cancelled flights, being unethical or uncaring when it comes to refunds or compensations, being unfair with costing when it comes to a change in original booking, declining quality, bad customer service, unreliable and do not deliver what they promise, woeful call centre delays, rude staff that take no liability for their mistakes, unpalatable onboard food, snobbish flight crew, lost baggage etc etc…… just to name a few.

My experience with Qantas was initially the onboard food, which was pathetic and unpalatable. Then, upon reaching my destination, I had the misfortune of “lost baggage” and thereafter learnt that the staff at Sydney Airport who assisted my 91 year old Mother-in-law and myself, did not produce any evidence for baggage claim once checked-in baggages were scanned and sent through on the conveyor belt. Soon after and the days that followed, I went on to experience staff at Call Centres based in Fiji, who were of no help whatsoever; Qantas Staff at Sydney Airport who refused to give out their names and who were utterly rude to my Sister who was following this case on my behalf whilst I was overseas; to a point of disconnecting her phone calls and refusing to pick up the phone again. All of my emails were automated responded, which became quite frustrating and there was not one phone call from Qantas-Australia (Sydney) that came through to me; to assure me that my baggage would be found instead of passing the buck; and finally after a month, Qantas has offered a meagre $300/- compensation when the contents of my baggage costed way more (although found and delivered after 72 hrs) but had to be discarded due to weather damage. I incurred additional expenses to have International roaming just to be readily available on call, should Qantas reach out to me; but, which never did happen.

Travelling is stressful enough and to have your baggage lost is anxiety at its peak, especially when Qantas - Australia were of absolute no use and it was Staff at Bangalore Airport who were polished in their Services and who were empathetic, compassionate and understanding of my plight and did everything to keep me informed of their follow-up, on a daily basis.

I boarded a direct 12 hr flight from Sydney to Bangalore, checking in 3 baggages, in total. It was from point A to point B and yet, Qantas could not even get this right and had lost 1 baggage somewhere. After several phone calls, Qantas washed their hands and justified themselves stating that there was no record of 1 baggage and that only 2 was on the system. How then, when their ground staff were the ones to check all 3 baggages, did one disappear off the records?

The incompetence of Qantas Customer Care has been more like going through heavy turbulence and their reputation is nosediving as the worst performing Airline.

I am yet to have this resolved with Qantas. Anyone wanting to join me to talk about their bad experience to take these issues to Current Affair, please email me at loisweightman@yahoo.com",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,So useless their online booking for Sth American flights never works,"Every time I've gone to book flights to South America, the Qantas website doesn't let you go to payment. It crashes every time after taking you through every step until payment. I tried different browsers, used the qantas app and the same thing happened. This happened in both April and July, when booking for Chile and then Peru. So then you have to spend hours waiting on the phone for some awful overseas service who then try to charge you much more than the price advertised on the qantas site - despite not enabling you to actually book online (yes, it's 2023 and qantas can't even get that right). After having to go through the phone for Chile - Qantas then charged me twice for the flight and took well over three weeks to refund thousands of dollars.
If you try to lodge a complaint, if you haven't actually flown yet, you get another number to call - you can't even lodge an online complaint which would be easy. The hilarious thing is that if it's urgent, they give you yet another phone number to call and that number isn't even manned outside of office hours and again, you have to wait for HOURS to make a complaint. This used to be an airline that Australia was proud of. You get better customer service and booking experiences on cheap low cost carriers.",April 2023,1,1,2,1,1,4,4,1

Was given an option to either accept (which obviously wouldn't work) or cancel.
We cancelled and immediately rebooked flights that worked. At this stage we have paid Qantas twice for the journey.
3 months later and despite numerous calls I do not have my refund. Responses have varied from its already been paid, to will be paid in 24 hours, to wait 21 days.
Finally lodged a complaint and after a week or so I was contacted to say I will not get a refund, only a travel credit. This is robbery.

cheaper than Singapore Airlines
All flights were on time
Cabin Crew and Counter staff were great.
At the end of the Melbourne to Adelaide flight the pilots invited my six year old grandson to the cockpit and spent 5-10 minutes with him explaining the controls

The Bad
Food was horrible almost inedible. Kids food was worse
Interior of our 4 planes looked worn
No direct flights from Adelaide to Singapore. A trip of 7 hours took 12hrs

The Ugly
Confirmation of seats on-line was easy except Qantas changed our seats without any pre warning, seating our 6 year old by himself in the middle of the plane. This happened to both our flights to and from Singapore. Apparently Qantas can change planes at any time leaving your seating confirmation null and void. Unacceptable Qantas, at least advise customers of any changes. Qantas counter staff were great and ultimately corrected this.

2,Worst vegetarian food in a lifetime Quantas!,"Quantas Quantas Quantas where have you been the last few years? You have lagged behind for about 20 years in the quality of your vegetarian ""meals"" if you can even call what you serve vegetarians food. If someone had to dream up the worst vegetarian meals its what Quantas serves. Try: pasta with boiled cauliflower main. A few pieces of rocket (thats all) salad. An inedible ""brownie"". Thats meal 1. Meal 2: boiled white rice with boiled green beans & curried chickpeas. Inedible. For that meal I ate 2 pieces of bread and a glass of water. And this was in Premium Economy. Also keeping us in a dark cabin for 12 of the 14 hours is passanger abuse. Quantas shows contempt by serving prison food to their guests never mind 12 hrs of darkness. Next time I travel Singapore Air for sure. Any vegan and vegetarians who have travelled Quantas deserve an apology and they need to GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. Vegan food can be delicious if you actually cared but obviously they dont.",July 2023,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1

1,Operates like a Budget Airline,"I regretfully convinced my partner to fly Qantas over Singapore because I'm a Gold Status member and told her that I can transfer my lounge pass and at least bid for an upgrade on her behalf. Then after booking, not only did it not allow me, but she even had to pay for seat selection! I'm so embarrassed for Qantas, they're meant to be a premium airline in Australia, and they're forcing people to pay $40 to $80 to select your seat like a budget airline. Really going downhill!",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Never Again!,"Was denied an upgrade due to insufficient points, even though we had enough to cover the upgrade. Call ‘customer services’ who pass you around every single department, none of which can help you. Turns out the Customer Service team based in the Phillipines can only help with reservations.

We were told 40 mins before we should have been boarding and the ground staff kept us at the airport for almost 3 more hours and moved us to a gate that had no lights on or air con for the first half hour. Eventually put us up in airport hotel and told to check out at 11am and they would open check in desk at 4pm. Shocking customer service.",June 2023,2,3,2,1,1,2,1,2

In-flight entertainment system not working during the entire flight for all passengers. Only served 1 meal (very minimal included, just 1 main & a piece of bread.) No breakfast or nothing offered in the morning prior to landing. Can't even request for another bottle of water, just refill.

1,"Qantas - A Joke Airline, that does not communicate.","A Joke Airline
Booked Vancouver-Los Angeles-Melbourne in December 2022 for travel following June. Qantas advised no direct flights Vancouver Melbourne!
For the return flight went to check-in at Vancouver and advised flight was cancelled . No prior advice from Qantas, no substitute flights offered by Qantas. I organized the first available flight out which was some 2 days hence. 10 hours later and having found a very budget hotel received advice from Qantas that the flight had been cancelled (I found that out 10 hours ago how come Qantas did not know?). 2 messages over 2 days from Qantas giving me flight changes for Los Angeles to Melbourne. That did not help me, being stranded in Vancouver. I have used Qantas as my preferred airline for 50+ years. Eventually flew out of Los Angeles 2 days later having taken a local Canadian airline to Los Angeles. Qantas will not be used by me again. 500,000 accumulated FF points will be used on Emirates.",July 2023,2,2,5,5,3,5,1,3
1,Terrible,I went on qantas direct flight for the first time and I will not make that terrible mistake again. The air hostess locked 2 toilets for 6 of them where as the rest of us passengers had only 4 for the flight duration of 12 hours and 35 mins. They said the toilets are out of service how ever we found them using those toilets for them selves on asking they had no response to give. Also the food options were minimal compared to other airlines.,July 2023,2,1,1,3,1,1,1,1
1,Worse customer experience,"Qantas review
In Feb 2022 I flew from Toronto to Sydney with Qantas. Being Australian I have low expectations of Qantas but this experience was something else. Each time I’ve flown with Qantas, my checked-in bag hasn’t made it. Usually, it arrives a few days / a week later but this time it never came. It was 1 of 2 checked bags. 1 made it 1 didn’t. At first the ground staff at the airport (not qantas) were helpful. It took me going down to the airport to get some support and at one stage we thought it had been tracked down but It had not. After many calls and visits to the airport, I had resided to the fact that, after 3 months the bag was lost. Amongst the things in the bag…my wife’s wedding dress and a handmade quilt from her grandmother. I understand that it is the ground grew at the airport not Qantas who lost my bag but this isn’t my complaint. This is….I stopped counting but I had spent over 20 hours on the phone to Qantas to get support. I’m very patient and understand the call centre operators didn’t lose my bag. I never lost my cool and was always polite. I was guiding them to a resolution. Either they could give me compensation for the bag which by law I was entitled to after 3 months or I would take the value in flight credits. Every single time I was told that they couldn’t do anything and that someone would call me back. That never happened. On one occasion I asked the call centre operator if I was wasting my time and if I would ever get a resolution and she said yes I was wasting my time. I actually felt sorry for her. She sounded broken. Fast forward 12 months, many more calls and a complaint lodged with the ombudsman and many more calls, I received the maximum compensation for my bag (half its value) and nothing more. I’ve flown all over the world and with many many airlines. I’ve flown with RyanAir and still Qantas is the most horrible customer experience I have ever had. Not just in airlines. Worst customer experience ever.",August 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1

1,Where is our luggage?,"What an absolute nightmare it is trying to deal with Qantas, so called ""Customer Service"" and ""Customer Care Specialists"". I have been a frequent flyer and Qantas Club member for 26 years and have never witness such a lack of customer service. I recently had to catch a Qantas domestic flight from Melbourne to Sydney to get an international flight with another airline. Our baggage was checked in at the designated Qantas counter for international connections and we were advised that our bags would be checked all the way to our final destination. Well, naturally this didn't happen and we had 5 people with no luggage for 3 days. One of the bags contained critical medications. I lodged a ""missed luggage report"" with the airline we were travelling on but they could not track where our baggage was. The following morning I contacted the local Qantas ""Customer Service"" only to be told that they could not assist in tracking our luggage. I continued to chase both Qantas and our other airline to try to locate our luggage with both denying responsibility. At least the other airline was able to tell me that the bags never made it to the connecting flight. After 3 days of living with out our luggage and me continuing to chase it, our luggage finally arrived with Qantas ""rush tags"" attached. When I returned home I sent an email to Qantas asking for an explanation for why our luggage didn't make the connecting flight, and why Qantas ""Customer Service"" didn't contact me to let me know that the bags wouldn't arrive. From that point on Qantas customer care specialist went into full deny mode and blame shifting to the other airline even though all evidence pointed to Qantas systems failing. There was no admission of any failure by Qantas and their ""Customer Care Specialist"" didn't even want to follow up to learn from the experience, just a hollow apology and a denial of any wrongdoing.",June 2023,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,1
2,Qantas doesn’t care about disabled people,"I was flying back home from a week long trip around Australia with a group of just under thirty. We were with a tour group that had booked the flight in advance, and because of the group we couldn’t upgrade our seats. It was a red eye flight and we would arrive in Hawaii in the morning. The group of four girls sat in front of me and my family were apart of my group and ranged from the age fourteen to twenty two. Within the first few minutes of the fasten seat belt sign initially going off, the girl in front of me had reclined their seats all the way. For context, I suffer from a genetic disorder that makes my joints ache-y and weak. I need to constantly stretch and the more leg room I have the better. I asked the girl in front of me if she could move up for the sake of my knee, and she did so, but then began to argue with me over it. Eventually she gave up and I leaned back in my seat with my leg propped up on my bag against the tray table. Only several minutes later she reclined so aggressively the chair smashed into my knee and it swelled. Her mother walked over and yelled at me for “demanding” things of her daughter as I was crying and asking for ice. The Qantas flight attendant went over and grabbed her manager, who told us, quote, “everyone is entitled to reclining their seat.” I told the woman I was disabled and needed the leg room, especially now that it was swelling, but she just kept repeating the same thing. I asked her to move me and she refused. Later, she showed the girl next to me how to recline her seat, which causes the young autistic girl next to me to go into a panic. The woman once again was completely unsympathetic and kept repeating that everyone was entitled to move their seat back. She told me that I should’ve booked a seat in front of the bulkhead in advance, and did not respond when I told her I could not, as the flight was booked as a group. It was very late at night and I was exhausted and couldn’t believe what was happening. It would have only mildly inconvenienced those young girls to sleep sitting up instead of fully reckoned, but still they refused. Qantas has shown me that they care more about the comfortability of their able-bodied passengers than the health of the disabled.",July 2023,1,3,4,1,2,3,4,3
1,Trip from hell,"International flight booked through Qantas as a member from Sydney to Catania, Sicily Italy return. After flying from Sydney to Perth, I land in Rome haven't slept, vomiting and am informed by a friend in personal messages that Catania airport is on fire.  I was then expecting to have a message/email from Qantas explaining this and next arrangements including some accommodation and/or new flight details to get me to my destination. 

Instead nothing, no word from Qantas. I ring them from the airport and they inform me that I will have to arrange everything myself with their allied airline which they arranged for me to fly with.

I spend no less than 4 hours at the desk and queues to try and arrange another flight and be put on standby lists. No sleep, head throbbed and struggling. I finally secure myself a flight for that evening 10pm, which actually runs 1.5 hours late, so 11.30pm. I'm so tired at this point I don't even recall the flight because I passed put in exhaustion.

I booked accommodation for when I arrived at the diverted airport as my accommodation was 3+ hours from there. No offer from Qantas on this either. I arrive at the airport after midnight standing at luggage carousels (I was informed 3 carousels might potentially have my luggage) awaiting my luggage, to no avail. At around 3/3.30am at this point I queue up for luggage lost and found complaints and lodge a lost request. 

I then make my way to exit the airport and lodge an uber request. Its 30 mins away and costs 60 euros, exhausted I accept. I then catch my uber to the hotel booked on booking.com to find that its a construction site and no hotel exists, despite booking it on a reputable website booking.com, paying and receiving receipts for my payments of over $300 AUD. After a neighbour further confirms the hotel doesn't exist I take the uber back to the airport costing another 60 euros. 

I was picked up 3+ hours later by family. thank goodness 

Much of the suffering endured could have been alleviated by Qantas taking accountability for flights booked with its loyal Australian customers, arranging for their flights and in the interim looking after their accommodation during delays.

I will not trust Qantas with my travels again.",July 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1
3,Long Flight from LAX,"As it's a very long 14+ hour flight, I would definitely choose Business class for a flat bed. My seat was 4K in the front cabin. I had a Grilled Chilean seabass for dinner, but it was more or steamed. The grilled seabass which I had in the Qantas LAX International Lounge was so much nicer. As I had a sore throat during the flight, I asked for a cup of warm salty water to gurgle, as the tap in the toilet didn't regulate the water temperature. The flight attendants were helpful.",July 2023,5,5,-1,4,4,4,5,5

1,Business class Qantas - a total disgrace,"Flew business class on our return from Bali - it was a night flight so my husband and I were hoping to get some sleep - we did not. first disappointment was the seat barely reclined. Secondly there was an insufficient barrier between business and economy and there was a loudly spoken passenger directly behind babbling on non stop. We were boarded at the same time as the economy passengers so there was no time for drinks before take off. Interestly, the loud babbler was already aboard with glass of champagne in hand before anyone else had boarded! The flight attendant did offer us a quick half glass once everyone had filed passed and we were about to taxi but said she would need to grab it back in a minute or so so drink up! Most disappointing of all was the food or lack of it. At 11pm at night the only thing on the menu that appealed to us was the cheese platter - not for us I am afraid. The embarrassed attendant explained there were only 6 and these had been ordered already. She graciously offered to ‘throw something together’ and returned with a couple of nuts a tiny piece of cheese 3 crackers and rotting iceberg lettuce that was passed off as a salad. I took a picture I was so disgusted! When I see record profits made by this airline I know where the costs have been cut! I have written to Qantas as yet no reply…",June 2023,1,1,3,4,1,4,1,1
1,Useless service airlines,"Our flights were delayed twice and we were infirmed just hrs before the delay. We had to fly from KL to SG to connect to London enroute to France. Our SG to London flught was delayed twice by almost 1 full day witout any conaideration for our onward connecting flights and hotel arrangements. Tye Qantas customer service line was horrible. With an avefage waiting time to speak to some is more than 30 mins. We had to call more than 5 times before someone actually helped us change our connecting flights. The first customer service officers told us our change of flught was confirmed but it didnt happen and no emails. We called again amd the new person informed us that no chanfe was ever made. This was going on back and forth and super frustrating that qantas cystomer service was of no help. We spend more than 4 hrs on the phone calling numerous time and waiting just to speak to someone. Was a horrible experience and we incurred extra cost for hotels, change of flights etc which qantas was not respi sible for albeit they delaying the flights. Truly for this experience i will never waste another flight with qantas. Not an ounce of help nor courtersy.",July 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Additional Baggage,I purchased a my flight through qantas. I had a baggage allowance of 30kg x 1 piece. I didnt have the weight but I'm carrying bulky items which requires me to purchase an additional bag. I was told by qantas that its a code share flight operated by Fiji AIrways and only they can add a bag or I have to add the extra luggage at the airport. It is very frustrating when airlines make internal deals with no care and regard for its passangers. Extrely dissapointed with Qantas.,July 2023,-1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Appalling service received for delayed baggage,"My daughter recently travelled to New Zealand from the UK (Qantas from Sydney to Christchurch) as part of an air cadet exchange program. On arriving at midnight after 2 days of travel her bag did not arrive. After spending hours reporting the missing luggage she was forced to sleep in the clothes she had been travelling in. The next day she was then escorted to buy a few essentials assuming the bag would show up soon. After 5 days it still had not shown up so she had to buy more things as there were specific activities planned for her and the other cadets and she did not have the right clothing to take part. Eventually six and a half days later her bag shows up, broken. No offer of compensation at all! They don't offer any unless it's 7 full days.
So not only is she out of pocket for several hundred pounds, she wasted many hours of her time, trying to contact Qantas with no reply to phone calls, emails or texts. She's spent hours travelling back and forward to Christchurch airport to see if the bag had turned up (because no one would respond by any other means). She's felt thoroughly miserable not having her own belongings and not being able to fully take part in the activities planned for her. This trip was meant to be a reward for her achievements in the air cadets and a once in a lifetime experience has been totally ruined.

1,"Qantas, the success is not when you do this business, but when you are happy to do it.","Absolutely horrible!! My suggestions are to AVOID any business with qantas.
I booked online flight to Thessaloniki in Greece one week ago. During the online process in a favour to complete my flight reservation, I choose the journey from Thessaloniki to Sydney in a duration of 26h and 40m and proceed to complete. However, after I paid the full amount and I received the confirmation e-ticket, the inbound journey was clearly showing almost 3days trip (leaving Thessaloniki on 30.9.23 and arriving in Sydney on 2.10.23), yes 3days trip via London.
I immediately called customer service to request a full refund, after an hour of explaining the situation (and 1h 13m) being on hold I was instructed that a refund will be less (around $250) from the ticket value, and I agree on that since I had no other choice.
After 3 days, I received refund of $3,151.92 from the ticket that I paid $3,964.22 and I lost $812.30
I removed qantas from my personal and my business list as well I instructed all my business associates to follow my action.",July 2023,3,4,4,1,1,3,1,5
1,Terrible selfish company,Qantas is a absolute joke. Terrible old planes and cramped seats. Flights are always delayed. We were delayed by 2 hrs and then 4 hrs.

2,"Very average, definitely not worth the cost if paying actual dollars","I travelled to Queenstown on Business Class with a friend via a Qantas points redemption. Overall I would have to say the experience was very average and barely adequate for a 3 hr trans-Tasman flight. I was certainly glad it was a redemption, as I would have been very disappointed if I had paid the $1600 price for this flight.

The only difference between this flight and Qantas domestic class appeared to be the champagne and more (frequent) drink service. To Qantas' credit, the Jacquart Cuvee champagne was quite nice and the pumpkin salad I had was quite nice. The accompaniments (biscuits and dessert) were very basic and below the standard I am used to on Virgin domestic business service. The beef and chicken dishes offered to other passengers were not to my taste at all and looked to be quite sloppy, below the standard expected for international business.

Some other points of note, firstly the check-in process was very slow. The ""priority"" queue was long and if you can use the automatic machines (for economy) it probably would have been quicker. As we were checking in skis and had a lot of bags (the main reason for travelling in business) we used the manual check-in. The process took over 20 mins. As a result of this and the long ""priority"" security line (not Qantas' fault, I know) we had very little time to spend in the lounge. The lounge time was further reduced by having to take a bus to a remote parking bay, which also meant there was no priority boarding and the flight also left and arrived late.

The food offerings in the international business lounge were similarly less extensive than what I have experienced in the past in the Air NZ lounge and Virgin domestic lounges, although still acceptable.

I also felt that the business seat was more upright in its normal position than the Virgin 737 business seat, and the recline was more limited (although I couldn't find exact figures, the seat pitch is 1"" more with Virgin).

Qantas also forgot to load the business noise-cancelling headphones on this flight and offered a 2000 point credit as a result (which was promptly delivered without further request, to their credit).

All up, I felt that Virgin domestic business was slightly better, even with the lack of IFE, footrest and USB charging, due to the more comfortable seat (at least to me), better food, and better lounges.

Unfortunately there are no wide-body flights to Queenstown but it is clear the 737 service falls very, very short of normal international business (i.e. wide-body) service. No tablecloth, the meal is presented on a single tray instead of individual plates, not even drip coffee available (instant only), and a very basic seat. Compared to trans-Tasman business I've experienced with Air NZ (old 767 and 777) and Emirates (A380) it felt more like premium economy. It's also disappointing that Qantas don't offer Wifi on international 737 flights.",June 2023,3,2,3,3,1,5,2,3
1,Quantas is getting worst day by day. Very expensive for the quality of the service,"I had flight from Rome to Sydney with stop in Perth, the first 15 hours flight was poor in terms of customer care and quality service.
Firstly the hostess in our sector was very rude, in 15 h she never smiled to the customers and when we asked something to her she was answering very rud. Secondly the food was ridiculous. I paid 1095 Euros to have a poor lunch, How can a flight from Rome with most of the customers on board from Italy gave Pasta that we all known how poor will be the quality... So We decided to get chicken salad and really I never had a meal worst than that, probably KFC made had better quality.
Then you dont even provide a dinner, we had to wait till the morning after to have a ridiculous breakfast made by unknown sausages and a stuff that was meant to be scrumble eggs but really you could do better! Even China Airlines provide a better service to their customers.
Also we were sitting close to the engine and the noise of that motor was insane and as you try to save as much money you can, you don't even provide earplugs or the normal bag with a toothbrush and all the necessaire to made customers confortable during a 15 hours flight.
Then once in Perth we had more than 2 hours delay and again on the flight to Sydney the meal was ridiculous.

I booked your company thinking was a good and customers care company but was a sad mistake.

1,Avoid at all cost,"By far the worst flight experience I've ever had and I firmly believe this company is a scam. My luggage was lost in February and despite following all instructions that were given to me by Qantas team members , I have yet to receive a refund for my lost items.

My bag was lost on my flight and upon landing in Australia I immediatly reported it missing and received a file reference number. I was told my bag was in Dallas TX and would arrive the following day. The next day I called to check on the status of my bag and was told it was ""delayed but on its way"".

My bag never arrived for the entirety of my trip. I was told to check in at the Dallas airport during my departure home to see if my bag was there, it wasn't. I was instructed to call customer service, the agent attempted to end my call without resolution because there is ""a time limit per call"". I push back and asked for resolution. The agent told me my bag would be shipped to my home address, it never came. I reached back out and was told to fill out a claims form to receive a refund for my lost items, and that I would be receiving an email shortly providing me with a case number. I was instructed to email my claims form back to this email address. The email never came.

I called customer service, after an hour of explaining the situation I was given the email address and instructed to submit my claims form with my file reference number. I got no response. I reached back out, no response.

Today I spent the last hour and 8 minutes with a customer service agent who told me my file reference number doesn't exist (yet every other agent was able to use it with no issue), then put me on a ""brief hold"" which lasted 20 minutes, then the call ended abruptly with no resolution.

I am at a loss of words with how disorganized this company is. I'm also extremely frustrated with having to put forth hours of my time and effort on a situation that has a very simple solution.

I was meant to get a Green Tier with all the consequent perks, but never got it. It’s been almost a year, however Qantas ‘Customer Insult Service’ wouldn’t even bother to do anything.

Been calling and sending emails to the customer service for a month now in vain. Every time they seem to be unaware of what’s been happening and it’s like something new they’ve never heard before.

On top of that, they hung up on my call in the middle of the conversation or make excuses as if the phone call was breaking up.

1,Qantas gets worse day by day,"My husband and I returned home from Brisbane on QF 0937 on the 26th June. Bear in mind this is a 5 hour trip.

Firstly, the plane was so old and the seats so small that it is getting ridiculous. If anyone is slightly on the heavy side, it is uncomfortable for them and also for those having to sit next to them.

The aisle is so narrow that is is almost impossible for two people to pass each other especially if the plane is full, which our plane was, as they can't duck into a spare space to let the person pass. It's not OK for someone to rub themselves against you. No way!

The Customer Service Manager (Darren) in my opinion was out of line in regards to a couple of his comments.
Firstly, he told the passengers to be polite and respectful to each other. Seriously Qantas?
Then he told the passengers that if anyone abused the alcohol he would 'cut it off'.
I am absolutely sick to death of 'WOKE' and he needs to be advised by management that these sort of comments are outrageous and not necessary.

Strongly suggest virgin or Jetstar. Won't bother with qantas and before this experience I thought they were the best airline.,June 2023,2,2,1,1,1,3,1,1

1,Qantas useless and a big rip off,Qantas is THE worst airline you could ever book with - flights delayed by many hours - filthy planes / no customer service at all - no one cares and you’ll pay $1300 for a 1.5 hour flight in economy ! A massive rip off airline snd a disgrace Shane on you qantas,June 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5,Amazing ground staff at Sydney airport - thankyou.,"The thing worth noting and reviewing is the incredible treatment I received after arriving at Sydney airport after being delayed and missing my connecting flight. A single female traveller arriving late at night the staff were friendly and helpful with Zac greeting me with a smile and giving me resources to get me through (transport, accomodation and information) until my rebooked flight the following day - very grateful.",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas and the same rubbish as Jetstar now days!!!,Pathetic 5 hour wait at the airport late in the night to say they had a motor problems to then hear that they were so late to take off that Tokyo international airport was closed for Qantas WARNING DONT FLY WITH THEM THEY ARE THE SAME AS JETSTAR RUBBISH!! Honestly!,May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,5 star review for Alliance Airlines staff operating QF1997,"This Qantas flight between Cairns and Uluru was operated by Alliance Airlines. It left on time (1.10pm) and arrived on time (28 June 2023). FlightRadar24 shows consistent on time performance for the past week. My recent flights on another airline 4 weeks earlier were 90 mins and 60 mins delayed, so I appreciated the on time performance. The Fokker 100, with an all economy, 2 x 3 seat configuration, is not the newest kid on the block, but it’s reliable. The Alliance cabin crew were exceptional, so a big shout out to Jayden and Mosi (apologies if I’ve mis-spelt your names!). Professional, engaging and clearly loving their jobs. About a 3 hour flight , with a pre-packaged ham and Bavarian mustard sandwich, or fresh fruit, served with juice, wine, tea/coffee and water. A second round of drinks were offered after the meal service, which was appreciated - no need to use the cabin crew call button. Not much to see at 34,000 feet as the unseasonal rain and extensive cloud band covering central Australia obscured the ground view. Smooth flight, with minimal bumps as we descended through the cloud cover prior to landing at Ayers Rock Airport, so thanks to the flight crew. The Fokker 100 may be old, but it sure beats the hell out of a Dash 8 turbo-prop that Qantas uses on many of its regional routes. I’d fly with Alliance Airlines anytime.",June 2023,5,5,-1,5,5,5,5,5
4,Relaible and full service,"We flew from Sydney to Brisbane.

Flight was uneventful and we arrived ontime.

Crew were friendly and a snack and drink included in the price of a ticket.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Terrible treatment,"I had booked and paid for 2 business class tickets in Dec 22 (using points plus pay). Boarding passes for myself and my sister were issued at luggage check-in. Upon arrival to business class lounge we were called up and told that only one of us could fly business, I requested to speak to a supervisor. I was put on to Karen (by phone). Karen gave me several reasons, all unsatisfactory but apologised and assured me that the points and funds difference would be credited to my account. She further said by way of compensation she would offer me a $500 credit for the inconvenience. I enquired if this was to be cash, she said no it was a credit to be used towards flights only.
Karen also subsequently met me at the gate before boarding and reiterated same.

I was so distressed and affected by this bad start to my special Christmas gift holiday to my sister, that I ended up having to go to the hospital in Singapore. and I was very ill for the first 2 days of our 10 day trip All of which can be evidenced. I am not seeking compensation for this aspect but it should be known so that you have a complete picture of what occurred and the knock on effect.

Qantas have shunted me from one department to another. First Customer Service (who apparently have no phone number), then Reservations Dept, then Frequent Flyer loyalty program. Each department tells me it is not under their purvue and that I need evidence of what Karen offered. I was told to go to the airport (a 4+ hour round trip for me) and to try to locate Karen at the airport. I explained that I would not be able to get to the business class lounge without a ticket and clearing customs - that Karen may not be working that day and that there may be many Karen's who work for qantas. I was told I should have taken a reference number for the offer made by Karen. Well I did not realise I needed to make a recording or get an affidavit from her on the day as I took her at face value, assumed (and still do believe) that she made this offer in good faith. I am now told after wasting days /weeks on this that the complaint has been closed. I was not advised of this via email and no explanation given, they just decided to close it. Astonishing! Now when I make an enquiry I keep getting replies stating the reference number does not exist, presumably because they unilaterally decided to close it.

Qantas need to honour their promise and obligation. ie
1. The correct amount of Frequent flyer loyalty points to be returned to my account (some points have been reinstated and then removed and I am querying the actual amount is correct).
2. For the compensation amount of $500 (for use towards flights ) to be added to my account as promised.",June 2023,3,1,4,1,1,4,1,1
1,Absolutely rude service,"My review relates to Flight QF1043 from Broome to Sydney on 30 June 2022 & concerns the flight attendant, David Crandel (if this is his name?), in the Business Class cabin where I was seated in 1A. Let me recount in detail the unacceptable experience I suffered on your flight at the hands of this employee.

I boarded this flight, which had been delayed, and sat in my allocated seat. As it happened, the woman seated next to me (I thought it was to be empty, according to the seat booking) had already taken up all the space in the overhead locker above, so the female flight attendant had to help me find some space in another locker, as I was sitting in Row 1 where no floor luggage is allowed. I will come back to this later. I note there is no priority boarding for Business Class at Broome airport, so my embarkation took a much longer time than usual when travelling Business Class (where I note, airline companies make most of their money, even domestically).

The aircraft departed and soon after (as I was seated in 1A) Mr Crandel came and asked me what meal I would prefer, the beef or chicken. I responded that I was vegetarian. He became indignant and asked me had I specifically requested a vegetarian meal. I said that this option had not been available in the online booking app where I had bought this flight ticket, but that my Qantas profile had this detail (you can check). He said, in a condescending tone, that he would see what he could do, and said that there might be an omelette available in the Economy cabin. I responded politely that that would be fine, as I am not vegan. He then asked me would I like to have a drink in the meantime, and I responded in the affirmative. He brought me a small bottle of the Grant Burge.

I then waited over 35 minutes while he fed & wined the other 11 passengers in the Business Class cabin. He did not speak to me at all during this time. He went back to the galley and was pulling drawers in and out, so I got out of my seat and approached him, and again politely asked if he’d had any luck in acquiring a meal for me. He appeared to be annoyed, and said he’s been very busy and that he hadn’t had time to chase up my particular needs. I asked him for his name and he refused to provide it and he appeared to have no name tag. I told him he’d only provided alcohol for me, at which point he grabbed the half empty bottle of Grant Burgeons from my tray. I then said that I’d paid over $2000 for this flight, and that angry mood further escalated and he shouted at me that I was bullying him and he would call the Federal Police and have me escorted off the plane and charged. when I asked (facetiously) what I would be charged with? He said bullying him. I repeated, that in fact he was bullying me and at fault with depriving me of a meal and only plying me with alcohol and that he would be reprimanded for wasting the time of the Federal Police. He then became extremely aggressive and ordered me back to my seat. I then said I wanted to speak to the Captain to First Officer, at which point he shouted, “They won’t see you!” and again threatened me with calling the Federal Police.

At this point in the commotion, another flight attendant appeared, “Libby” - I think the senior flight attendant from the Economy Cabin. She told me his name, after I asked her repeatedly, and she asked him to provide me with a chicken meal so I could pick off the chicken and eat the vegetables, and the cheese etc., which he begrudgingly did. Libby brought me a glass of Chardonnay and tried her best to calm the situation, but said she did not want to get involved or give me her surname.

Coming in to land, after the seat belt sign came on, Mr Crandel did not take my bags on the floor at my feet, which I thought was mandatory in Row 1 when landing? WHS?

The whole experience of encountering such a rude and unbalanced flight attendant as Mr Crandel, was completely unacceptable. I have written multiple emails to Qantas without ever receiving a response to my complaint",July 2022,4,5,5,1,1,3,2,1
2,Shame on you qantas.you are a good name for bad product.,Terrible food . No games no music selection on entertainment .not all passengers watch movies. Me and my wife always listen to music on our flights.i don't think it is that hard to include it.,May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Best Long Haul Flight,"This was one of the best long haul flights I have had.
The crew were attentive and fun.
Nothing was a bother, even though there were many babies.
I think I slept better because the whole feeling in the plane was relaxed.
Well done team.",June 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
1,Fly another airline if you can!!!,"Qantas completely messed up my family holiday by cancelling my entire booking not once but twice. No explanation, no apology. Just sent me around in circles. Loss of over 400,000 points on accommodation that they won't refund. They just ignore customer complaints.",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,"Flight not bad, booking a total mess","I recently flew to London from Australia and spent time deciding the best option, as it happens I booked from Whyalla to Adelaide then to Perth then direct to London. Of course within a few weeks of booking (back in February) my itinerary was changed. Turns out I had to book the Whyalla to Adelaide with another carrier for $150 whilst my dear friends at Qantas offered me a ""refund""of $62 since reduced to $54. Qantas cancelled the connecting flight
I rang on four occasions before I left to chase my money and each time I rang I got a different answer.The last time Qantas said you have to complete all the flights (which included Zurich back to Australia) before you can get a refund. So I get home and 10 days after the refund had supposedly gone through low and behold still no money, isn't that a surprise. To add insult to injury when you ring Qantas a recorded message comes on to say 90% of refunds are put through within a week. Pull the other one they must think we all came down with the last shower.
What does make you wonder is the time taken to take the money off you online when you make a booking is about 30 seconds but not quite the same the other way. It is high time some legal body investigated these deplorable actions.",June 2023,2,3,4,1,2,3,3,3
2,Business Class trip CBR to BNE,"The overall Qantas business product is not where it previously was. Having taken the same flight down with Virgin Business it is interesting comparing the two products, Virgin was overall a better product.
Qantas check in, at Canberra (CBR) could not even see dedicated business check in and used the general boarding machines. Qantas lounge is comfortable but no dedicated business lounge in CBR just one shared with Qantas Club. At time of boarding, they just called the flight so no priority for business or premium FF members. On the plane we were only offered water prior to the flight. The plane was comfortable, and the seating was good. The meal was good overall, but we were not offered any re-fills or a second beverage. Basically, the attendant seemed to be looking at herself in her phone screen over providing service. Following service my empty water bottle and napkin clearly was visible in the front seat pocked but was never cleaned up, even though there was plenty of time on completion of the lunch service. Finally, the bags well again no business priority, the bag came out amongst all the general baggage. Being a premium FF, the premium baggage service has been nonexistent since Qantas moved to contractors.",June 2023,4,4,3,2,1,3,2,3
1,Not professional business - Waste of money,"Due to COVID-19 booking was credited in Qantas Pass, some of that credit was used when booked for one way flight from Gold Coast to Sydney Qantas booking reference is 6Z55B2. Due to the queue at the counter, I was 3min late at Gold Coast Airport for baggage tag as the check in was already done. I was told that the system has been closed and they cannot serve me and I have to book for another flight. I had to look for another flight somewhere else as the rate was high in Qantas. I travelled with my family including 16months baby and had to stay for 3hrs plus to wait for the flight. This is affected me extremely mentally and financially since covid-19. Another extreme unhappy experience.",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1
3,Rebooked from a cancelled Jetstar flight - was certainly not the upgrade we'd hoped,"So, Jetstar cancelled our booked flight, but after some slight issues got us on to this flight. Yay, we thought. We were homeward bound. Not without some chaos. First, the flight was delayed for 20 minutes. Fine, no big deal. Then, it was delayed another 20 minutes which was slightly irritating, especially since there was no explanations/apologies/staff to contact until the pilot made an announcement after take-off. But, then they changed the gate at the last minute and made all passengers travel to the other side of the terminal. They then announced on the plane that the catering on-board was limited in order to prevent further delays - I appreciate this is a no-win situation and passengers will be unhappy whatever happens, but this just seemed like the cherry on top.

The crew was kind enough and did their best with the hand that we were dealt, but was still not pleasant. A lot of disgruntled and tired passengers. Oh, and we paid for extra legroom seats with Jetstar, and weren't able to get them on Qantas. Understandable, but still another irritation. Have submitted a refund request and will see how that goes (Ha! I think we all know what to expect of Jetstar, frankly)",June 2023,2,3,-1,3,-1,-1,3,-1
1,Worst airline,My mom was ment to fly back to SA on the 24th of June. The original flight from Sydney to Johannesburg was delayed by 7hours. This was after she had a 14-hour layover because Sydney airport does not stay open at night. The flight was then canceled a few hours before the flight. They rebooked it for the NEXT DAY (26th of June) AT 22:00PM. She had to be there for 48hours! If they managed it properly and made the cancelations earlier then my mom would have been able to spend 2 extra days with us. They have no proper communication. No transparency and we wont be flying with Qantas ever again. I wont recommend them anymore to friends or family.,May 2023,3,3,3,4,1,3,1,3

5,Brilliant service on the Flying Kangaroo,It has been a very tough few years for the airline industry and I am an a avid traveller and decided to try the Perth to London direct route on Qantas. Qantas has been getting a bad rap lately so I thought I would share what a great experience I encountered. Service from checkin to onboard was excellent. The flight attendents we had were happy and always willing to help. The food and drinks were of an excellent standard as was the entertainment. Would I fly them again? Absolutely. Their safety standard speaks for itself. I love Qantas and as a proud Australian its like being at home when you step onboard!,May 2023,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,5
5,A great flight,It is a long time since I have given Qantas 5 stars but in this case it was deserved. The flight left early and landed early. We got a hot panini and a wine on board. The flight had free Wifi. The baggage came off fast in Hobart. The on board staff are average as is often the case with Qantas but this was a great flight.,June 2023,4,4,5,3,3,4,5,5
1,Worst refund/cancellation policy ever,"Read the small print for all refund/cancellation policies. Said I could get a full refund in quantas credit for my flights of $3050. I took this option as the new flights I wanted to book were $2271. However, when you use your credit, it forces you to book flights at a DIFFERENT price to the normal price advertised. It ended up charging me an EXTRA $550. So Auckland to Sydney return total of $3600, when the normal online price was $2271. This was not obvious to me when I chose qantas credit and is obviously in the small print. Will never fly Qantas again.",June 2023,1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1

1,Disaster,"A disaster.
The boarding gate at Christchurch opened late. Boarding was therefore chaotic.
When all were onboard the flight was then awaiting a de-icing machine.
When the Qantas de-icer arrived it did not work.
Then another hour sitting waiting for an Air NZ de-icer.
Eventually took off over 2 hours late.
Arrived in Sydney and no available gate to disembark and so sat on the runway for more delay.
No assistance on disembarking. Had to go through security screening. Bit silly that as had just come off of a Qantas International flight.
Incoming international flight security screening took ages with (once again) only one scanner working.
After screening found that the flight was gone.
Nearby international transit desk closed.
A major task to find the only open transit desk which was on the other side of the terminal - with no signage.
At transit desk only one person working - with a queue of 20+ waiting. (Poor employee. Felt sorry for her with no attempt by Qantas to help).
Eventually told I was re-routed via Tokyo.
Arrived Bkk 14 hours late.
NO baggage at airport.
More lost time reporting lost baggage.

So, overall, a really very, very, very, bad experience with Qantas.",June 2023,2,2,2,3,2,2,1,1
1,Still waiting for a solution,"Disappointed and waiting for a solution over 6-8 months. Been waiting so long for Qantas to sort out my membership issues, lost flight points and compensation for being stuck in the airport for 30 hrs. - SR8315442",January 2023,2,3,1,1,2,2,2,2
2,Dirty Cabin,"I was on a flight from port hedland to sydney, the tray table on board was stained of someones coffee and the seat was pretty old onboard the Boeing 737. However this was annoying and gross the crew where alright there was one of them that was grumpy but I will give qantas another chance.",May 2023,2,1,2,2,1,1,1,2
2,Crumbling Qantas,"Shortly before our flight from Sydney to Darwin, I completed my check in process and had the e-tickets issued and added to my wallet. Within half an hour, I was contacted by Qantas Customer Service, advising me that they had “lost their business class cabin” for that flight.
I asked where had it gone? Many frustrated phone calls later, and with the help of our terrific travel agent, it turned out that after initially offering only ONE of our TWO tickets back in business class. & the other “perhaps” in Economy, by Qantas, that our travel agent was able to find several business class seats still available for the same flight!!
What a debacle! And it left us wondering why bother with paying more, if that’s how Qantas treats “valued” customers!!
Thank goodness our travel agent persevered for us!
Without her, who knows when we could have sorted this administrative MESS!!",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Traveling in the back of a van for 10 hours would have been more comfortable,","Qantas has gone hill imo. The seats are cramped, not enough overhead space and the online ""entertainment"" i use the term lightly, was abysmal and i had no sound as my seats' earphone connection was damaged. The flight attendants were awesome however and the meals, I felt were quite nice. I will not travel economy with them again, but you have to book business class pretty quickly though as there is only limited seats and even if they were not the greatest Business Class, I have seen they would have been a def improvment. Qantas, need to not jam people in a small aircraft, if you are doing a 3 hour plus flight, you have the right to a somewhat basic level of comfort, ?No. You, will be on my ""least favourite"" flight company.",June 2023,1,1,1,4,2,1,4,5
4,Holiday flight,The flight over was a very pleasant and a full flight. However in all my travels I have never experienced a flight attendant telling me that I was not allowed to exercise at the back of the plane. This is only for crew. On a 9 hour flight I need to stretch,June 2023,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,5
2,Flying under minimum standards.,"Looking at the past reviews... ...how on earth could Qantas be rated higher than a 3. I guess if you land at your destination they have achieved their primary purpose. But if the plane is late to board, late to take off, late to land, and U write this now because I have ample time because it has been 40min since landing and the PA announcement has just said the baggage handlers are approaching the plane to unload.

I guess every dollar counts, even at customer expense (I will miss appointments now), but no tears allowed in the future when they fall (most likely begging for tax payer assistance)",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"rude ground staff, terrible customer service","Booking the tickets was fine, its getting them to issue the eticket that was a problem. Contacting customer service to resolve the issues was also bad. It took them over 3 months to send me my eticket and even then my connecting flight was changed by them without informing me. Spend another week calling them non stop to fix the problem. I won't go in full details as if you look up other travel forums they are well documented. This is the result of qantas outsourcing to call centres in South Africa, Philippines or India where they just follow the script and are very rude.
The ground staff at Sydney airport where just plain rude, aggressive and lazy. The complimentary bus transfer that qantas operate for its customers to travel between T1 and T3 was chaotic. The two male staff where too busy talking or playing with their phones. So when the bus arrives its a mad scramble for everyone to push in line and get on board. On the return trip back I was put onto a later connecting flight even though the flight wasn't departing for another hour by the time I got to the gate. Only found this out when I was at the international to domestic connection counter that I found this out. Furthermore a specific staff (attached photo) who was guiding the waiting line on that morning was extremely rude, not helpful and was brushing people off so she can continue talking to her colleague. I have already logged a complaint to qantas (including her name and the time and date she was stationed) about her but never receive a reply back. I received friendly and helpful interaction from the staff at westjet when flying internally in Canada then the staff at qantas and yet qantas is supposedly the better airline?
Onboard the flight, I was not expecting anything good or special. The meals was cold and serving was small. The cabin was dirty. More signs of qantas maximise profits at all cost.",August 2022,2,2,-1,1,1,1,1,2

4,Not a bad flight.,"The final leg of my journey home after a trip overseas. The aircraft was clean, comfortable and on the seats contained the standard small pillow, blanket and headphones. The seats were comfortable enough and leg room was okay. The flight was on time and landed in Sydney on time as well. The food was okay with plenty of drinks on offer.",May 2023,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4
5,Flying As It Should Be,"My sister and I had flown to visit our sister who resides north of Sydney. The flight home was on a Qantas Aerobus, surely the largest planes I have ever flown on. We opted for Premium Economy, one step up from economy and worth every penny. Blankets and pillows, noise cancelling headphone, excellent movies, wonderful food and complimentary wine. The staff were excellent and any request or need taken care of right away. A long flight but fairly comfortable. I wish Qantas operated all of the USA travel! We had assistance in getting through the airport and to the boarding gate. It was a long process and I would recommend arriving to do this 3 hours before boarding. We had 2 1/2 and just made it to the gate with maybe 15 minutes to spare. Thank you Qantas for taking care of us!!!",June 2023,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5
2,A letdown - Inconsistent standards across different international flights,"I had a pretty enjoyable trip from Singapore to Melbourne. However, the experience that Qantas offers does not seem to be consistent. The trip from Sydney to Singapore was a letdown.

1. The crew members need to be more attentive. We were among the last rows being served the meal. While we could understand that sometimes certain food would not longer be available in the cart, it would not be acceptable when the passenger was handed the meal was given without any cutlery and was told to wait for the bread to come. Of course, it ended up the crew member forgot after it after almost a 10-minute wait. In addition, no one responded after the 'assistance' button was pressed. We had to catch the attention of a crew member who happened to be attending to another passenger. and that was another 5-minute wait.

2. Safety - Lack of vigilance: The overhead compartment above my seat was fully packed. When a passenger took her bag out to unpack, she did not close the cover of the compartment. It was more than 5 minutes of the flight time. This could be very dangerous, especially for the passengers who sat below or near the compartment. HOWEVER, none of the crew members went around to look out for such.

3. It was a A380 plane with double decks. The 'hidden' passage way for the crew members were situation besides the toilets. While we understand the crew members need to access this area, there were occasional crowds around that area. This could be done more quietly and with more consideration of passengers seated around.

Professionalism of the crew and standards could definitely be better.",June 2023,4,4,2,1,3,4,5,4
1,No seat selection available in advance - even if willing to pay,"Bought seats for my wife and me 3-4 months in advance. Did NOT purchase through discount web site, but on Qantas web site. Economy seats were roughly $1,500 each. Was not allowed to select seats at the time of purchase, but figured I could do so for a fee later, although their web site says that seat selection is complimentary.

As is often the case, time got away from me and I didn't deal with it until a few days before departure. Couldn't do so either on their app or online. I even had signed up for their frequent flyer program.

Checked in online and then saw that our seats were both center seats and quite a few rows apart. My wife and I are 66 years old and I typically will pay up to $200/seat to get exit row or bulk head on an international flight.

At least at the airport the Qantas clerk got us together, but neither seat was aisle as we requested. The guy on the aisle must have slept 8 of the 15.5 hours of the flight, and we both ended up climbing over him by stepping on the arm rests...two 66 year olds, lol!

Anyway, suffice it to say I will never fly Qantas again!",May 2023,3,4,5,4,3,4,1,4
2,Long delay to and from Perth,"I’m disappointed with #Qantas after both my flights to and from Exmouth were delayed by 5hrs.

Despite the flights being 10 days apart it appears as though there have been mechanical faults with the plane both times, necessitating both a plane swap and crew swap.

Nor does this appear to be a one off, as another passenger on this flight stated his plane from Perth to Exmouth 5 days ago also had a mechanical failure and long delay.

One failure would be a coincidence. Two seems problematic. Three in 10 days appears to be a pattern.

Not only that but there is minimal support and facilities at Learmonth airport - difficult when you are travelling with a two year old and Qantas only communicates the delay late (when you’re already at the airport)",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

2,Not the Qantas it used to be,"Flew economy to london. As a 6ft 5 guy i try to get an extra legroom seat. Managed to get one the day before flying when checking in. Free of charge. Get to the airport and they bumped me to a middle row seat because they decided to sell the seat. I wasnt even given the option to pay or i would have. Poor from Qantas but i get thats why the name isnt what it used to be. Will be flying Emirates or Qatar in the future. The Direct flight isnt what its all cracked up to be, more space on the 380 in economy. I couldnt even reach down and touch my toes without hitting the seat infront.",June 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,avoid,"With no knowledge Qantas flew international CHC to Melbourne then pushed me onto a domestic flight to Sydney - took five hours to negotiate then nearly missing international connection to London.
No apology and Qantas doesn't even reply to query except take it up with insurance
Qantas don't care",June 2023,4,4,2,1,1,4,4,4
1,OVER PRICED,"No Service
No Gluten Free Food as requested
No Smiles
No baggage service
No cabin space
No hopeful ground crew",April 2023,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1
3,Disappointing,"Whilst management and the Shareholder's make a pretty penny, the people who got them there are treated to tired, dirty planes.
The sandwich on offer was disgusting and I couldn't believe there was no tea or coffee served?? Qantas likes to brag about an all inclusive experience, however I would rather pay for a better meal. Also tried to change a flight coming back and they were going to charge more one way than we paid for a return flight??!! We ended up cancelling the flight altogether and had a great flight back with Virgin.
The Qantas Lounge is disappointing - they didn't even offer fruit and the pickings were slim. What has happened to this airline? Only good thing about them is the staff on board the flight.",June 2023,4,2,2,2,2,1,4,1
2,Qantas pay more get the same,"since covud i have travelled with Qantas 4 time twice flights have been delayed.
everyone complains about jetsatr etc.always being delayed i have also traveled with jetstar twice and both times on time.
Why do we pay extra for qantas no longer in flight entertainment.Unless you want to watch on phone.Pay more and get the same as everyone else.
I will be carefully considering who i fly with next time.",June 2023,2,2,1,3,-1,3,3,3
1,Qantas took no responsibility for staff & systems fail costing customer $thousands.,"We booked a return family flights to Europe 10 months in advance to get a good price and availability. Later, a flight was cancelled so I called Qantas to rebook.
But behind the scenes something was wrong with the new booking. I don't know if it was a staff error or technical error, but the new booking only existed in one of their systems but not another. I had a feeling something was wrong because I couldn't see the booking when I logged into the Qantas online portal. Over several months I called Qantas about 10 times and spent over 100 hours on hold waiting for customer service as I tried to make sure our booking was valid. Each time, I was assured that the booking was fine. The customer service agent would re-send the itinerary to put me at ease.
The day before our flight, I called again because I couldn't complete online check-in or book a meal online. Again, I was assured the booking was fine and I should sort it out at the airport. But I called again and kept asking questions until eventually at 2am the staff member looked in a different system and found that my booking didn't exist.
I asked for alternative flights but nothing was available to anywhere in southern Europe for a week or so. This wasn't an option for us since we needed to arrive on time for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday.
Qantas offered no alternative apart from a few thousand points as compensation for these mistakes with their systems.
We ended up booking the last available seats with Thai Airways. Actually, I found this flight to be very comfortable. The food was good, staff were kind, and the change in Bangkok worked well.
I'll avoid Qantas any chance I get. Thai and many other alternatives are a better choice.",July 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1
3,Poor Business Class,Qantas' business class is very poor. The armchair that turns into a bed is old. The in-flight service is poor and inappropriate. The food served on board on a 14-hour flight is economy class food. Not worth it. Not worth the money spent. Hope never to fly again with Qantas. Wake-up!!!,May 2023,4,3,2,3,2,3,3,2
4,"Great, friendly service in economy",My second-ever flight on QF2 from London to Sydney (via refueling stop in Singapore) was operated by an Airbus A380. The last one was in 2019. This was a night flight so most of the time was spent sleeping and in and out of movies. Service from the FAs was good especially during sleep time as I was able to request water and promptly received my request. The best service was from the check-in clerk at Heathrow who was quick to give me an aisle seat when I asked. He also informed me that I need not worry too much as the seat next to me would be empty all the way to Sydney. Great and friendly service.,May 2023,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,5
3,"Unkind, uncaring cabin crew","I was unfortunate enough to suffer a nose bleed on my recent flight. The cabin crew were so unkind, and unhelpful. To the point that they ignored my calls for help when the bleeding was intense (they switched off the little blue call light twice!).
Waiting for the medical team to collect me at the airport, the head steward actually stopped near my seat to perform some task, and didn't so much as look at me or ask how I was doing. This crew is a disgrace, and if this is the Spirit of Australia, I feel sorry for its citizens.",May 2023,4,4,2,1,2,4,4,4
4,Customer Service at Check In - Melbourne,"I would like to thank Philip Green for his impeccable customer service. He was professional, polite and very understanding and a pleasure to deal with. Qantas you need more people like Philip. Made our check-in process and absolute breeze and made us feel so at ease. Thank you Philip.",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,"Good, Solid Domestic First Class","Great check-in experience, beautiful lounge and food. Gate area was orderly. The plane was obviously an older 737 but it was well-appointed in First Class. Service was prompt and friendly. We were pleasantly surprised overall and would recommend them highly.",April 2023,5,5,2,5,4,4,4,4
3,OK but not quite there,"My partner and I flew qantas business class and whilst not bad there is definitely room for improvement. Seat/bed was fine, food good, entertainment good and service acceptable. However, beverages were disappointing, only one white wine, 2 reds, of which one(shiraz) ran out. How does that happen on an Australian international business class airline? It smacked of cheapness. Overall, you'll have noticed that nothing was very good or even excellent. I flew Swiss business class on the same trip and they were far better. What has happened at qantas?",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Amazing service from Qantas,"I’ve had a couple of bad flights with other airlines previously, and can be picky, but I had to write a review after my flight to Hong Kong a few days prior, where I received excellent customer service and was taken care of very well.
The air hostess Michelle was great, her safety demo was very informative as well.
Excellent service = happy customer, I will be returning and hopefully on Michelle’s flight again.",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,horrible decline in food and beverage in economy,"I recently made my first overseas trip post Covid.
I made in total 9 flights. 2 were with Qantas and 2 were code share with Emirates.
I was seriously shocked at the dismal and contemptuous standard of the food and beverage service on Qantas. You are served only a tiny plate of mushy hot food with a tiny roll and a dry piece of generic cake. This is the standard of NSW rail.... not a compliment.
Emirates has continued with the traditional full tray of airline food and repeat beverage service. On a long flight meal service is one of the things that passes the time. To be served something more suitable to a short domestic flight was a shock.
I suppose the idea is to encourage passengers to book premium or business. For me I will just book another airline.
I really hate to be treated like dirt.
The inflight entertainment service was glitchy. My screen kept freezing and would and the touch screen often would not respond. The cabin crew tried to help by rebooting. No difference. Others around me had the same problem so this must be a system issue. It was impossible to select and watch a movie. Fortunately I had brought a book. Again Emirates were vastly better.
I left the flights both ways just seething.
Never again unless there is no alternative.",May 2023,2,2,1,1,3,3,1,1
1,I was charged twice and customer service is terrible,"I booked a flight at the beginning of the month. A trip I’ve been waiting to make for decades to visit family and was finally able to do so.
After I made my booking, I realized I needed to make a slight change to my itinerary. I called Qantas and they suggested I rebook and that my first booking would be cancelled and I would not be charged.
I did as advised and all seemed well.
A few days later, I looked at my bank account, which I do most mornings, and throughout the day, because I live paycheck to paycheck and saw my account was overdrawn by almost $5,000. I quickly saw what had happened : I was charged for my original flight that was cancelled and that I was told I wouldn’t be charged for by Qantas and also for my new booking.
I called Qantas immediately and proceeded to spend the next 4 hours on the phone talking with different Customer Service works and hearing something different from each person.
The last person I spoke with actually gave me a case number and told me the refund would be proceeded in 3-5 days.
That night, I received an email from Qantas saying my refund was being processed and it usually to 6-8 weeks.
My account is still overdrawn and my savings account is now frozen. I’ve been calling the BBB and the FAA and emailing any email I can find for Qantas. No money and no response.
I’m unable to pay my bills right now and I’m getting no help from Qantas despite this being completely their fault.
I haven’t even flown with them and already I have a very negative view of the company.
I’d advise anyone against supporting a company that won’t do whatever they can to right a wrong they created.
Really disappointing to say the least.
Totally at a loss for what more I can do.",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Bad Check-in kiosks,Check-in kiosks require a smartphone to scan a QR code for checking-in. What if my phone runs out of battery. There is no Qantas staff around to help out. Please note that not everyone has a smartphone.,May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Yet another delay,This was the last sector on an international itinerary. We were delayed in Sydney and ended up in transit for 6 hours instead of 4 hours. The lounge is very average with grotty showers and toilets. Time for a refurb. The international bus transfer is also very average. The flight was late yet again. Qantas planes are also tatty and this was no exception. At least the inflight wifi passes the time. I am not impressed.,May 2023,4,3,5,1,2,2,1,3
3,Filthy toilets and shabby plane,"It is great that Qantas fly from Haneda - so much more convenient than Narita. We used the Sakura Lounge in terminal 3 as Qantas Gold. Ok lounge but nothing special. The plane was packed. The seats are showing their age. Old and shabby. Toilets are dirty and not cleaned during the flight. The usual I don’t care attitude from Qantas flight attendants. Food ok. Didn’t watch movies as tired. We arrived early and bags came off fast. Time for Qantas to refresh the fleet. And get some new enthusiasm from staff. Really tired Product. Even with gold membership, I am rethinking who I fly with.",May 2023,3,3,5,2,4,1,4,4
4,Cancelled our flight 05/05/23,In the taxi to Perth airport we received a message to say that our 1050am flight was cancelled and Qantas put us on a later flight that would have got us to Sydney tooooo late for our connecting flight to Honolulu. I went into panic mode and went straight to the service desk tosee if anyrthing could be done. The lady was very helpful and after about 10 minutes she put us on standby for an erlier flight( no guarantee that we would get on) Fortunately we got seats on the 1005am flight and made it to Sydney to get our connecting flight. It pays to get to the airport early otherwise we could have not got to our destination on time. Thanks Qantas you were great..,May 2023,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,3
5,Business class A330 - Sydney. -Seoul ( Incheon ) - Sydney,"Flew Sydney to Seoul (Incheon) return QF87 and QF88 on this route re-introduced in late 2022.

The A330 business class cabin layout provides good privacy on the even numbered window seats with a little less privacy on the odd numbered window seats.

Full lay flat bed with comfortable mattress and pillow and blanket. Pyjamas and amenity bags provided however you may need to ask for pyjamas if you would like them on the outgoing sector as this is a day flight.

After leaving the Qantas International Lounge boarding is generally quick if you board during the priority boarding prior to general boarding commencing.

Greeted as I entered the aircraft and shortly after you take your seat you are again greeted by the cabin crew and a pre-departure drink is offered.

The crew are very friendly and still maintain a professional but relaxed service.

Meal orders were taken with some of the more popular (seared snapper dish) being unavailable by the time my order was taken in row 4 however the other options of which I chose Bannockburn chicken that was enjoyable.

A nice choice of wines, spirits , soft drinks juice and water to compliment the meals and snacks provided throughout the flight.

Dinner service was offered later in the flight prior to arrival into Seoul.

The inflight entertainment screen is a good size and offers plenty of movies , television programs, music Podcasts throughout the over 10hr flight.

Sarah , Marie , Louise and Travis were the flight crew attending to the business cabin on QF87 with Travis coming through the cabin shortly before landing to thank passengers for their business and ensuring that the service received was excellent.

Excellent start and finish to holiday in Seoul flying Qantas business class and look forward to further flights.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas the most delayed airline ever.,"Been in and out of the country for the last 3 months.
Everytime qantas is Late. At least 3 hours. Causing me to miss other connecting flights.
Once 2 weeks ago travelling to Sydney from Brisbane then Manila.
Flights from Brisbane was 3 hours late. Off course when I got to Sydney I lost the Manila flight.
The rude lady at the desk said they would not provide a hotel because wasn't their fault..(who's fault was it then)
Then they flew me to Bali then to Manila. So I arrived 12 hours late.
The point is if you don't care about arriving on time..EVER!!!!
Then go with qantas. But if you have business meetings, important things to attend.
STAY AWAY FROM qantas. They are cutting costs in a way that the airline is suffering. And the customer service is a joke, rude.
Would love to see this company disapear",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,A good international flight,"I get so used to grumbling about Qantas these days that it is nice to write a good review. This is a new service non-stop to Seoul operated by the A330. The plane was not full so I had 2 empty seats next to me. The food was a highlight - 2 hot meals were served with choices and nice wines. The service was also friendly and polite - I must say the non-Anglo background staff are much nicer than the whites. The entertainment was good as well.

My only issue is the filthy toilets. Many other carriers check the toilets often and clean them through out the flight. Qantas do not.

Also, why not greet your Golds as well as the Platinums. I fly a lot with you too!",May 2023,3,4,5,4,4,2,4,5
3,"Delays, changes, delays","I was supposed to fly to Fiji from Canberra this month for business but was informed by a Qantas message that my flight would be delayed the next day. Then another text confirming another 2 delays before I was then rerouted to Melbourne instead of Sydney and take the international connection from there. Not complaining about that but just the inconvenience of that. The same happened for my connection back to Canberra - another delay at Brisbane but pilots made up for it with a nice apology. I am not one to fret about delays as I understand the many behind the flights activities that are happening, but would be great if Qantas can help to minimise this or address these challenges so as to provide a hassle free, stress free flight. As a QF member, I choose to fly Qantas for many reason but especially so for the points etc - so Qantas, please keep improving your service. You still my number 1 choice for flights though :)",May 2023,3,3,2,4,3,3,3,3
1,4th Strike out of 6 flights. What has happened to our flag airline?,"Something is very broken at Qantas. We pay premium fare money for poor service. I can get the same flight for $64 with other airlines. Two people return over $1000.

Boarded, all good tarmac out, on the run way, did not even get to full power and drove down the runway to go to service bay. Should be ok after engineers check it out. Thirty minutes later off loaded and had to walk from gate 28 to gate 6, Change planes. Meant to arrive in Hobart approx 1630. Arrived about 1900.

Cabin staff were excellent. Pilot could not apologise often enough but that doesn't solve the root issues.

The snack are revolting. Bring back cheese and bickies.

No alcohol before 1600. Some of us have been up all night and just want to relax.

My history last few flight.

Melb - Cairns.
3 attempts at take off. Change planes. No meal, limited service in contradiction to T& C's Arrived very late.

Melb - Hobart Return
4 Hour delay departure Melb arrived in Hobart after midnight. Hotel closed.
Should have been offered Qantas Club (as happened in Singapore before.) but nothing.
Went to service desk late and asked why not? They offered me a voucher but all cafes shut. Not lunch no tea,
3 hour delay departure Hobart.

Melb - Bne
My luggage went to Adelaide, I was going to Bne.. My vessel was meant to sail but luggage late.

Paying top dollar for rubbish. Melb Hobart planes old, no entertainment. Poor

Hope the new boss can do better than Alan.",May 2023,2,2,1,5,1,3,4,1
1,Messy confused phone service,Tried to get a few answers for questions we had about connecting flights but after 3 calls to 3 confused phone operators we just booked Cathay Pacifoc instead. To much hassle please train your people properly as it really should be that hard.,May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Terrible Service!,"Qantas was disappointing. It is considered a top airline, but my first experience with them on a Brisbane to Los Angeles trip was underwhelming.

The plane was old and lacked adapters for charging devices, with only one USB port. Additionally, the entertainment options were limited.

When requesting a drink, the crew would often bring just a can without a cup or ice, which was inconvenient.

The dinner consisted of lamb with mashed potatoes, but the meat was chewy and the taste was unpleasant. The meal lacked accompanying items like bread, butter, salad, or dessert. For breakfast, served an hour before landing, the crew informed the last three rows that hot meals had run out, offering only granola and yogurt instead. This was surprising and not ideal, as I have never encountered a complete shortage of meals on a flight before.

Considering the extra cost I paid for Qantas and my expectation of excellent customer service, I found their performance to be subpar compared to other airlines I have flown with.",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Enough of the salsa and corn chips,"This was a typical Qantas domestic flight - got us there but nothing special. I am so over the corn chips and salsa snack. Enough already!

Baggage was distributed over 2 different carousels causing confusion in Sydney.

A very average airline these days with a tatty old plane with no WiFi working.",May 2023,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1
2,Shocking baggage service in Hobart,"This was the last leg of a roundtrip to Samoa where we had used points. We flew domestically from Sydney to Hobart via MEL. The first flight was delayed but we made our connection. The in flight service was fine with a nice meal and good service. But when we got to Hobart no bags... a few others were in the same situation. There was no-one to help. Yep Hobart is not a huge place, but this is a capital city airport with multiple QF flights a day. The bag conveyor just stopped and nothing. We had to walk up to the counter area and scan a QR code to lodge our own baggage claim. This process gives you a number to call which I tried to do the next day as I needed to know where the bags were as I was due to leave for another trip 2 days later... I called 10 times over 2 hours and no answer or way to leave a message. In the end, I had to call the airport authority to ask them to pass a message to Qantas baggage. Then I got the good news that the bags had been found and both had flown in the next morning. A courier was despatched and arrived at my house at 2pm with ONE bag. Where is the other one??? The courier had on idea. Two hours later, the second bag was delivered by the same courier. The tags show that both bags came in on the SAME flight. Qantas are incompetent. Such poor service for anyone - let alone a gold frequent flyer travelling business class. Shocking penny pinching.",May 2023,5,4,5,1,2,3,4,5
2,Horrible customer service - care about shareholders and profit not passengers,"Paid over $22k for 2 business seats on QF1 and QF2 to UK. Before Singapore the entertainment system failed. No entertainment on 14 hour leg to London. No call button and seat won't move all the time they kept restarting system. Got our connection to Madrid as did one of the qantas crew. Our luggage did not make it. I could add more.

Qantas empathy 3 x emails with 10.000 points. Not even a call.

Be a shareholder not a passenger. They only care about profits and bonuses.",May 2023,3,4,1,1,1,2,4,2
4,Not too bad.,"Flight was delayed by 50 minutes, however, the crew had us delivered to Jakarta on time. The flight was okay, as was the service. Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing remarkable either. Just an efficient service to get people to a destination.",May 2023,4,3,3,4,3,4,3,3
1,The worst experience I have ever had with a company from start to finish!,"My friends and I were booking flights to Perth. We had booked a one-way flight for $350 and the next
day we saw a Qantas deal for $175 each way if you were paying return. My friend called Qantas if we could cancel that flight and book under the deal. They said we will give you a credit for your flight and you can book the deal with the credit but we had to do it online. We attempted to do so and it said we would have to call to apply for the credit. The next person we spoke to said no you can't use the credit for this. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls of multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. My return flight became a separate booking as I was returning to Adelaide a day sooner so I had to call separately. At one point I had agreed to pay a gap of $40 to change the flights and asked to confirm that I would not be charged a full new fair they said yes only $40 and then hung up on me and proceeded to take $350 out of my bank account with no permission and eventually refunded to me. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls from multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer.
We all had the flights confirmed in the Qantas app and it said the credit was in our accounts. I never received any information to say I owed additional money, no emails, no calls and nothing in my online account or app.
We were able to check in to the airport using the app for our flight into Perth and had no issues.
When I was in Perth, I attempted to check in for my return flight to which it said I was checked in but would have to collect a boarding pass from the service desk at the airport. I called to see if there were any issues. It was at this point while I was in another state that they proceeded to tell me that I had to pay another $309 to get home. I said that is not accurate but they refused to help so I went to the airport the following day to hopefully speak to someone in person. The lady at the desk called Elisabeth provided me with another terrible experience saying she could do nothing and I would have to call the reservations line again to sort it out. I said the flight leaves in an hour and it takes 40 minutes of being on hold before I can get through so she after making a big fuss called them herself. The whole time she mocked me and to who she was on the phone with directly in front of me. When I showed them the deal I booked and gave them the booking code that I had been provided they refused and said it wasn't valid. They said just because it said 'confirmed' in my app meant that I had a booking but I had to now pay for a ticket. I said if you listen to the recordings of the conversation you can hear them say they would honour the deal and it was all sorted, they then said no this will have been deleted now and the notes say something different. I said I had no additional funds to pay for a ticket to get home because their company told me the deal would be honoured. They refused and boarding was closing in 5 minutes so I was forced to borrow money from a family member to pay for the ticket. They said it wasn’t their problem and it was up to me, even though they had let me fly into another state without telling me I still had money outstanding on my return flight. I asked for her full name which she refused and said to call her just 'Lizzy'. I asked for the name of the person on the phone and she said 'no I can't remember' even though she used it multiple times in the call and seemed to know them very well. I asked for her employee number and she refused. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said no one could help me. My friends were able to check in normally the next day and returned home with no issues. They did not have to pay additional funds as I did.
I tried to provide Qantas with feedback which I did twice and have not had a response in over two weeks. I have never had a more traumatic, draining or stressful experience with a company. Qantas could not have cared less about their customers experience and what they had to go through.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Got there but bags missed connection,"This was the first leg of a flight to Hobart via Melbourne. We checked in as normal with a slighty tight connection but no indication of any delays. The lounge was average considering it was a business lounge. Some people offered icecreams and others (like us) ignored.

There was no gate shown on the board which started to make me nervous. Then it become clear that we could be late. The lounge staff were not helpful and just said oh well you have 20 minutes in Melbourne now, it will be fine.... Hmmmm sure!

The flight itself was fine and we got the good news from the purser that one of our pilots was operating the Hobart flight afterwards.

The meal was amazing - pumpkin crusted with dukka. Really good and friendly service.",May 2023,5,5,5,5,3,3,1,5
2,Inappropriate Qantas Boeing 737-800 Aircraft for Business Class Trans-Tasman,"After an agreeable Auckland lounge experience we were very disappointed with the cramped business class seats, weak audio, limited range of Entertainment options, modest food & drink options. Staff were professional but overall experience was very underwhelming. It looked extremely uncomfortable in the 6 seats across economy class behind us. Would definitely try and avoid this aircraft and Qantas facilities in future.",May 2023,2,2,2,3,1,3,3,2

3,Very average,"Flew Christchurch/Sydney/Bangkok then Singapore/Melbourne/Christchurch. Aircraft fine, staff/aircrew polite and helpful. But the food????? Very limited choice, chicken sandwich was well browned burger bun with light dressing and hint of chicken. And this is business class!!!! And this not a one off - flight from Singapore served up the same. Our inter connecting Qantas flight was delayed 12 hours, had to phone Qantas emergency number to reschedule, was told because a weekend call back Monday as staff away for the weekend!!!!! And this is emergency number. So Qantas, bad bad bad. Get your act together and dont leave other passengers stranded because it is a weekend. Would need to be desperate to fly Qantas again.",April 2023,5,5,5,3,2,5,4,1
1,They don't care about you.,"I paid more than double the price of other carriers to fly with Qantas because I wanted a nice flight, and I wanted to support a 'nice' airline. In the past Qantas was generous, hospitable and thoughtful. But now they are totally short-term-profit-driven. I couldn't get a beer on a three-hour flight. I couldn't get a cup, or an ice cube for the one soft drink I was offered. I couldn't even get some tomato sauce for the one tiny pie I was given for lunch. The whole flight was just an succession of experiences of their cost-cutting. Qantas' upper-management are staunchly against their employee unions, their flight crews, and their employees in general. And now I can even see that they don't care about their customers, either. The whole thing just made me feel like a (small) number on their P&L statement. ...I'll never fly with these guys again. I'm going to support airlines that care about their people and airlines that give me 5c sauces and 1c ice cubes.",May 2023,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,1

So I called and a supposed ""adviser"", Tom B, said they're just transitional & you won't be debited. I don't know whether he was LYING or just INCOMPETENT! The 3 debits went through to my account, as well as the 4th time with him when it was done with his supposed ""assistance"". Total debited = $1,460 instead of $365. Some days later QW refunded 2 of the 3 incorrect debits. Tom promised to get it fixed. Several days went by and no news = I cancelled the order. Tom sat on his fat behind and did nothing until told complaints will be coming. Finally got my 3rd debit back, but had to wait over a week for the refund of the actual buy. This meant it was after the Visa cycle closed so I have to fund their INCOMPETENCE for an extra month = UGGHH! Said I wanted compo for the 3 hours of my lost time their INCOMPETENCE had caused. Got Nada! So typical of a heavyweight using the old Chinese symbol of FU and crushing their customers. Guess we have fund the leprechaun's big salary & bonuses.",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,1
2,Non existent rude service,"Qantas service is just terrible these days. We used our points to fly business and we’re really disappointed. Us passengers were just a nuisance to them and their chats. The service was appalling and offhand.

The flight left Apia late with no explanation or apology from pilots.

At least dinner was better than the breakfast on the outbound flight.

The best part is that we passengers don’t get pillows and mattresses but the resting flight attendants lounging around in our business cabin do. Sums up Qantas and their approach to service. All senior staff who don’t care.

We won’t buy tickets in Qantas in future, and seriously rethinking who we earn points from. Time to move to velocity?

Lounge in Apia was small but at least they gave us service in there.",May 2023,5,3,5,1,1,2,2,3
3,Standards have slipped!,"Where to start? Toilets were STINKY. and not serviced with toilet paper and hand towel enough.
My TV was dirty with childrens handprints everywhere, the meal tray was also dirty. As the flight was not full I moved into the next seat only to find it the same.
For dinner I chose beef and vegetables, the vegs were cold and the meat barely warm, certainly not up to safe temperature.",May 2023,3,3,3,3,2,1,4,1

Both my flights were delayed and not just for a few minutes, one was 1.3hrs and the other was 4hrs. The service was horrible and I’m disgusted and the condition of the planes.

1,Unreasonable terms and conditions!,"I had a return ticket from Melbourne to Madrid. I used the outbound flight but cancelled the return flight for which I said I was given flight credit. Regardless of how they under-calculated the flight credit, when I wanted to use my flight credit from Melbourne to Seoul, they said it is not possible as the credit should be used for the same route that I had cancelled the flight (Madrid to Melbourne)! I show them their own website information that says flight credit could be used in other routes, but they said it is not possible for me because I had used part of my flight (outbound) and only cancelled my return ticket!

2,Two Flights- One Day- Both Late!,"What does the average traveller expect of an airline:
# that safety standards are maintained.
# the aircraft leaves and arrives on time.
# the aircraft is clean.
# aircrew are professional
# luggage turns up when it should.

I recently took two domestic flights with Qantas and on a number of the above points Qantas failed.

Both flights were late. Passengers were left scrambling to make connections and it was obvious that there was a failure to communicate. The planes were dirty. On my flight between Newcastle and Brisbane the section of seat behind the tray table was badly stained, on the flight between Brisbane and Bundaberg there were crumbs and rubbish from previous flights. The waiting area in the terminal in Brisbane was worn, dark and grubby.

Cabin crew were professional and efficient. They are not to blame. Qantas if you claim to be a full service airline- lift your game!",May 2023,4,4,1,4,2,1,3,2

4,Trip to the UK,"I recently travelled to the UK and three flights were required for the trip... the first leg was completed by Qantas on behalf of Emirates.

Boarding was smooth with an on-time departure. Staff were engaging and friendly. Meals were very good on the flight. The only carry on I had was a small bag which meant I didn't have to vie for room in the overhead lockers that people manage to cram their essentials ( I swear for some of them it's a week or two worth of clothing).

I did 6 flights to get to and from the UK in April and this was by far, the best of them.",April 2023,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4
1,Greedy company,"So, I booked a flight with Qantas to US from Singapore before COVID happened. Unfortunately, our flights got cancelled because of the pandemic and they gave us flight credits that expire in 2023.

Today, I am trying to redeem the credits for the same flights from Singapore to the US but they don't allow it. They limit the destinations for the use of these flights credits to Australia or New Zealand, not places that I wanted to go or have ever wanted to go.
I can't even transfer my credits to my friends who want to go to Australia.
I have sent a number of emails to them and they do not reply. Their help desk is not helpful and hard to navigate.
I am literally just watching my money go down the drain because of this greedy corporation.

Their customer service afterwards was terrible I spent 5 days on the phone trying to locate our luggage having to explain myself every time there is no customer service once you have travelled.
We had to go out and buy some basic clothes as we had nothing to wear( this was an holiday of a lifetime too) and 7 weeks later we still haven’t received a penny.

After checking in , I was rung by Qantas , in the departure lounge to say I had been downgraded to Economy. Although they gave me some compensation at the time, they said I would need to apply for a refund of the difference in fares (£873) , via my travel agent , on my return home.

This was done on 4th November 2022. Six months later I am still waiting for that refund. I contacted Qantas customer care but they were no help at all.",October 2022,2,2,3,2,2,3,1,3
2,Qantas need to lift their standards,"So disappointed with the standards of Qantas. We were served lunch, which was 2 small sausages, lots of mash potato & pees. Sorry to say but it was very much the standard of some nursing home food! The flight was 50 mins late departing, no issues with the weather conditions. Qantas co-share with Emirates so our return trip from Christchurch was an Emirates flight and wow the food was just amazing and 1st class standard for Economy class. It was a dinner flight on the return, but the overall experience was one that we would definitely book Emirates next time!",May 2023,3,4,3,3,2,5,3,1
4,International Business Class Flight,"I flew back from Honolulu to Sydney last week in Business Class on QF104. The Qantas A330 is an excellent international aircraft with plenty of space and a lie-flat bed. As is usually the case, the flight attendants were great, couldn't do enough for us and were professional and very friendly. The food was great, except that they didn't have any of my lunch choice left, and the champagne plus other drinks were free flowing. The only issue with this flight was that it was late in boarding, they told us due to the cleaning crew still being on the plane at that time, which resulted in both boarding as well as take-off and landing all being about an hour late.",May 2023,5,5,5,5,4,5,2,5

Senior cabin crew who had a half empty cabin but could not be bothered to give service, resting flight attendants sitting in business seats playing on phones while my polite request for a tea was ignored etc…. My tray table was filthy too.

The catering was very average and they don’t even load pillows and blankets. The excuse was COVID but what the? I flew to London on Qantas in 2021 and got a pillow and a blanket….

Baggage at other end was slow and not delivered in priority order.

4,Gold Coast in Winter,Had the good fortune of flying to the Gold Coast for a winter break with Qantas on a credit trip not taken last year.

They have no competent personnel to address complaints regarding issues of; no online checkin, arrogant pilot and flight crew, lying ground crew, late take off and arrival, late retrieval of luggage. Their CEO Alan Joyce and Customers Director Markus Svensson are no better and invisible to the complaints when I copied them in. They should fold the business for good in my opinion when their customer reviews are generally so bad, ranging from 1.5-3.5 out of 5. It’s a pity the score starts from 1, or else I would have given them a zero.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,Good flight but the catering is terrible,This was a reward booking on the all economy 717 plane. We got the exit row which was good for extra legroom. The service was pleasant enough with wine offered for free but the catering is terrible. I hate the runny salsa and chips pack. They give it out so often. Over it! No streaming of entertainment on the flight. On arrival no priority given to priority tagged bags… we get there about 20 minutes late.,May 2023,5,4,1,4,3,4,4,2

1,"Flight delayed almost 2 hours over a cookie, leads to 6 hour layover","I was doing 3 connecting flights from Wellington to Philadelphia. The first flight, from 4 am to 6:45 am we sat in the waiting area. We were supposed to board at 5:10 am. This 1:35 delay made me miss my next flight, so the rescheduled me to another flight. No biggie. But they then wouldn't give me my replacement boarding pass because it was 55 minutes from take off time. (1 hour necessary for weighing the plane(?)) so they had to rebook me again- with now a 6 hour layover in Sydney. The whole rebooking process took over an hour, and when I asked why my initial flight was delayed the way it was, the flight attendant said it was an issue with the bakery.
They gave us a F*king cookie. Its a 3 hour flight. Just say ‘sorry, no food this flight so as to not delay 50 people with connections.’ It was a 28 hour travel day, that a qantas cookie turned into a 34 hour travel day. Needless to say, i will be looking to avoid qantas in the future. Reading their other reviews, this seems to be a common occurrence. To be fair, their staff was patient, for the most part. That was appreciated.",May 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

2,Flaky booking systems,"A word of warning, be very, very careful amending a booking online. Qantas's systems are flaky at best.

We lost our previous seats. Trying to get a refund is like trying to get blood from a stone.",February 2023,3,3,2,3,2,3,2,2
1,Qantas Treats People Terribly,"Horrible policies, horrible customer service. I would say there is NO service. Qantas simply don't respond to emails and when they do, they are so not helpful. 1. At Qantas they don't take responsibility for your checked in luggage or for any missing parts of it that have been damaged during the flight (I flew with many other companies in EU such as Lufthansa where it's an opposite example). 2. Qantas cancel flights in the last minute which where paid a top price - absolutely unacceptable when the airline is not a cheap charter company. 3. Qantas treat people if they are a forgotten luggage. I will personally avoid at all costs flying Qantas. Absolutely no value provided for the prices they demand.",January 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1
1,Airline do not accept any liability for complete damage of baggage,"It was unexpected for me to find out that the airline declined to offer any support for replacing or fixing my damaged baggage, despite me reporting the damage.

1,Worst customer service ever,"Baggage was delayed on arrival at Queenstown. Completed all formalities and was advised that we could buy up to A$200 each for necessities. We duly did and total for both of us under NZ$200. Submitted the claim for the refund. That’s when the fun began. Claim was submitted on 1 Jan 2023. To date and many emails and phone calls still no refund and no correspondence from Qantas. Now it’s not about the money it’s now about the principle. Worst customer service from an airline I have ever received. I am fairly well travelled and have flown on quite a few airlines, both National carriers and budget, never received such bad service. If you want a tip, never fly Qantas even if the flight is free.",December 2022,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3
1,Never again,"After spending a lovely 5 day holiday in Surfers Paradise with my family (2 adults and 2 children), we used public transport to get to Brisbane airport, this was easy to do and cheap (took about 2 and 1/2 hours).

We arrived at the Qantas check-in and we couldn't check-in our bags. Yes we were super early (~6 hours before our flight). But with no one at the check-in we had no idea when we could. My partner tried ringing Qantas but got no response. There was little to no communication from them apart from when my partner had checked us in the previous day, and this was to say that due to flooding the check-in was via the kiosks. (Seemed plausible until we arrived - kiosks were on the 4th floor).

Plane was late leaving in the end, meant to leave at 6.40pm, didn't depart until close to 8pm, again not communicated this. Just kept saying that boarding was soon.

After sitting down in the seats we realized we had made a bad decision, seats super narrow, no leg room and the belt was only just long enough. Are only short and skinny people allowed to fly, since I felt very uncomfortable during the next 4 hours of the flight.

The meal was pretty good, that's about the only positive on this flight.

The headset had a bad wire connection, the touch screen was very slow to operate, could hardly hear the communication from captain although this could be due to the very noisy plane.

To sum up our experience, we had expected more from the Australians national carrier, but nope it's just a glorified Jetstar. We will now and forever use AirNZ, since all the problems we had with Qantas was not an issue with AirNZ. Cost between these two flights weren't alot and we didn't want to fly Jetstar for all the reasons we experienced on Qantas. How wrong were we.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,Clarify the boarding process,"We visited from America and flew Qantas for the first time. I liked the free onboard Viasat Wi-Fi that worked throughout the flight. I also liked the free tablets to see movies. I liked the announced request to respect others. Improvements: Use the monitors to inform pax. 1 Please tell pax how you will board them. First come first served? By row from the back of the plane? By zone? All good options but tell us what will happen! 2 Put info on monitors. Do not just communicate by speaking Australian English because some people do not speak English in an international airport! If you put info on the monitor, then people who are not fluent can read the text or use a translation app. 3 If you only give information by speaking, it discriminates against deaf people.",April 2023,3,4,5,5,4,5,2,5
2,Trip of a lifetime ruined by Qantas,"Flight from Sydney to London had a delay of just under 12 hours in Singapore, should have been a 2 hour stop over. Nowhere to stay/sleep or eat during that time. We lost one full day of our 4 day stay in London as a result. We should have arrived in London just after 6am. We arrived just before 5pm. The flight crew from Sydney to Singapire were great, very attentive and appeared happy to be dealing with us. Our son received a children's play pack. The second crew from Singapore to London treated us like we were a major inconvenience to them. Asking them for a drink after 5 hours of no service was met with a grunt, an eye roll and a very curt response of ""fine"". One can of drink was given to my husband when we both asked for one, no glass provided. The response to the initial request made me too hesitant to ask where the second can was. The entire second leg of the flight was a horrible experience. We were kept waiting g for 15 minutes at the departure for a first class passenger who couldn't be bothered to arrive on time. In a A380, 90% of the paying customers are in economy but 99% of all attention is on the 3 people in first class. This has been a long awaited holiday - my first in 30 years and I am so disappointed that I chose Qantas. Won't make that mistake again.",April 2023,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,2
2,Seriously needs a major overhaul and new management,"An hour late in taking off due to technical issues (hear it a lot on Qantas flights). Physical size of aircraft and toilet amenities totally inadequate for number of passengers on a flight in excess of four hours eg Melbourne to Perth. We calculated 2 wc cubicles for approximately 160 people plus flight crew. Front end wc not permitted for economy class passengers as communicated by head stewardess. Too bad if you needed to use urgently!!
Food served in soggy cardboard boxes. Unbelievable! Spirit of Australia 🇦🇺 don't think so. PS flight attendants do the best they can under the circumstances and are always pleasant.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Stranded in Singapore airport for an additional 6 hours on top of the initial 6 hours anyway (which we were fine with),"Stranded in Singapore airport for over 6 hours, we were given $20 vouchers each and most of the shops within the airport didn't take them. So we had to use our own money again, we had to rebook another coach for an additional £88 we had to rearrange taxis and pay more.

It was detrimental on our health. It took us nearly a week to adjust back again and obviously those 6 hours didn't help. It was poor communication on the delay. We had nowhere to stay but in plastic chairs for 12 hours. There were bodied sleeping on the floor, steps behind/beside us.

I've flown with so many other airlines and they have been so considerate in delays. However THIS company you couldn't get blood out of a stone.

So here is the kicker...
Qantas offered us GBP53.92 (AUD100) between the two of us. It's absolutely pathetic a big company like this offering so petty amounts. This didn't even cover our two drinks. So if you get delayed don't expect the world because you will get fisted.

AVOID flying with this company.
I will never fly with this company again after spending over £4,000 on flights.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,My first-time experience (and is my last time ever to fly on Qantas),"This was my first-time flying on Qantas from Christchurch, New Zealand to Seattle, USA with stopovers at Sydney and Los Angeles. I have pledged to myself that it is my very LAST TIME EVER to fly on Qantas. Their customer service is nothing but disappointing and callous. They never admit to making mistakes and never own up to responsibilities. NEVER fly on Qantas ever again.

My connecting flight from Los Angeles to Seattle via Alaska Airlines (codeshare partner) was never booked and confirmed despite their email confirmation sent to me when I paid for the entire itinerary. It was one hell of nightmare for the two of us getting stuck at LAX when Alaska Airlines had no tickets for us to board the connecting flight. We were unable to board and ended up getting stuck at LAX for 12 long hours to finally catch the next available flights after exhaustive work done by the passengers (me and my wife). Qantas failed to pass our ticketing information to Alaska Airlines the entire time since tickets were purchased and paid for a month before the departure date. Despite Qantas email confirmation explicitly confirming the Alaska connecting flight, it was false and incorrect. Alaska has its own unique booking system requiring totally different booking record numbers from Qantas booking record numbers. Yet Qantas failed to convert to Alaska unique system the entire time. When I reported the horrific experience to Qantas post-flight, they had no sympathy, no admission to error, and obviously no desire to own up to their mistake. I submitted all evidence to Qantas which only went to a black hole.

I was so wrong that Qantas was a reputable airline carrier. So wrong about this! I will NEVER fly on Qantas. Negative reviews written by other users about Qantas are valid and worth noting. For your own sake, stay away from Qantas.",March 2023,3,3,2,1,1,2,1,2
2,Poor facilities at Learmonth Airport,"Very poor service at Learmonth Airport today 25/04/23. The flight to Perth QF1603 left with a delay of over 1 hour which caused people to miss their connecting flight to Sydney. When boarding the plane at Learmonth airport, Qantas staff did not have a scanning machine for the boarding passes. Instead the name of each passenger had to be crossed off a list. Then the count didn’t match up and people had to wait for another count to be done. It was very poor. People had to wait 7.5 hours in Perth for the next flight to Sydney which was the Red Eye. Very disappointing.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Business class seat not reclining- refund offered but declined post travel,Business seat was not reclining and I was offered a 100% refund by ground staff if I chose to travel. I was assured that customer service would follow through. The 15 hour journey was uncomfortable even though I had paid an arm and leg for it. After multiple email exchanges spanning 9 days I was offered a AUD 500 voucher for a flight originating from Australia and told that ticket would not be refunded. This was the absolute worst way to end a holiday.,April 2023,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3
2,Qantas sucks,"Three hour delay, bumped to crappy seat near window which agrivates my back injury, same old crappy biscuits.

1,Unbelievable,"Worst airline ever- never ever use them as a carrier. They cancelled our connecting flight and rebooked it the following day. We were stuck in Sydney for the night and Qantas was unwilling to help us. Lucky our connecting flight was with Emirates and they helped us with the process of getting out of the airport and finding us someone from Qantas which was next to impossible. I was talking to Qantas the entire time on the phone and they were so unwilling to help and even blaming us for booking the flight on the wrong day which was not true, they then said Emirates had concealed our ticket and Qantas could not update us as they did not have my email- which is also untrue as our flights had all been booked online and you can not do that with out providing an email- she later said she had sent the new details to my email which she magically managed to do without us even providing the email address that she did not have. Lucky the manager at the counter was far more reasonable and helped us find out what has happened and yes it was Qantas!! They had been unbooking and rebooking our flights on their own accord to get a cheaper deal through Emirates… and had done it multiple times and then rebooked on the flowing day. The counter manager was able to get us a room for the night and a taxi back and forward- unfortunately by this time we had already been sitting the at airport trying to get everything sorted for HOURS! We had a about 3 hours at the hotel and then had to be back to continue on our journey. It was the dishonesty and the blame game that made this 1000 times worse. Will never fly with Qantas again!!",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Will definitely be travelling with you again.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Never Again Qantas,My son travelled from Bangalore to Sydney in a direct flight of around 11.5 hours. The experience was pathetic. First of all the flight was delayed for an hour.

3,"Aweful food, wonderful staff, departed and arrived as advertised","The plane to Bali was much smaller than in the past and the seats were very uncomfortable. The food was inedible, and I usually enjoy airline food. However, the staff were as wonderful as ever and we did depart and arrive at the scheduled times. A lot of us went to Bali at the same time and those that flew Jetstar had a horrible experience. Their flight turned around after two hours, due to mechanical problems and it took them several days to finally get another flight. One friend who was booked with Jetstar couldn't wait and finally re-booked with Qantas to ensure that they actually got to their destination.",April 2023,5,2,3,5,5,5,5,1
1,Poorly run airline,"Late again, this time by one hour thereby impacting our schedule and follow on activities. QANTAS truly is a poorly run airline and they should be ashamed of their performance. The airline was dated with no entertainment system and cleanliness was poor. Food on this occasion was satisfactory.",April 2023,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,3
1,Late again,You would think that a one-hour 15 minute flight between two capital cities would be a routine task for the largest Australian owned airline; think again as the airline was late again and it appeared that airline staff shared little care or empathy. To cap it off the aircraft was filthy with food scraps on our seat and floor.,April 2023,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2

What’s more the plane ran out of fuel and then instead of taking 17 hours to get home it took 29!",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Tired,"Check in staff for Qantas were rude, refused to check me in until they opened the flight and told me to come back. When I did check in, no priority ticket was placed on my luggage so delays on arrival waiting for the bags.

The Qantas international lounge in Brisbane airport was woeful, crowded, loud and the most uncomfortable seats I have ever encountered. Food was ordinary.
Phone recharging was hit and miss as half don't work.

Flight crew were excellent in business class. Friendly and engaging.
Flatbed seats, still confining, hard and uncomfortable. Definitely needs a revamp.",March 2023,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,3
5,Don’t mention the “D” word,"After having a joint family celebration in Sydney, we all returned to Melbourne on flight QF477 and it couldn’t have been more enjoyable.

The staff doted on my Grandson and he loved it! Mentioning to them that this is only his second flight - the first being in a Dash 8. They broke us up by saying - Don’t Mention the ‘D’ Word!!

I have to add the A330’s comfort in Business Class was an added bonus.",April 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
5,Greatest Arline of all time / Best experience ever,"My Qantas flight was one of the best I had. I got upgraded to business after putting in a request before the flight. The miracle of an upgrade made the long 13 and a half hour flight a lot less painful. The crew weee wonderful with even getting me my dinner hot and fast as I was tired from the day before. I quickly went to sleep in the padded massage like flat business class seats which were a wonderful upgrade from the previous in 2020 and before. Once I woke up I headed to the wonderful spacious business and first onboard lounge which had plenty of fruit and snacks and a place to sit and relax in a luxurious living room style area. When I went back to my seat to have breakfast the crew was very quick to greet me and say good morning and bring me some juice of my choice before my breakfast came. My breakfast was very enjoyable and delicious.

I rare my experience as one to remember and I will definitely fly Qantas again and would 1000% recommend this wonderful accommodating airline to many who would like to fly and travel the world.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas do not give a toss about service!,"As regular travellers to Perth for many years to visit family, usually with Qatar who are excellent, we thought we'd try the non stop Qantas flight in premium economy at £2500 each, to avoid any possible COVID stops. Travelling in December 2022 returning January 23.

We booked exactly 11 months early through dial a flight (Tara) who were excellent, and booked our seats, one of the pairs. About 3 months later I went on to manage my booking to find our seats were not booked as we would have to wait to book them the day before flying. Spoke to dial a flight who were as bemused as we were but suggested we pay the balance early to see if that worked, it did not! I was on the manage my booking every day for 3 months before a pair of seats were available outbound and 6 weeks later I managed to get return seats. All the time their website was saying book your flights then book your seats! Oh no you can't! I am still waiting a reply to my complaint from Qantas Customer Service that I sent in June 2022.

At Heathrow we checked in and got through security etc. to find that our flight had no take off time. After a while it said we were delayed 10 hours and we all trouped off to the Qantas desk to be told a pilot was either ill or out of hours. We received a £5 voucher each as compensation. We booked into a lounge for £72 only to soon find the screen said we were to go to gate for boarding. We eventually took off about 5 hours late. Flight not too bad and plane ok, premium seats are wider and a little extra legroom but entertainment very poor and food not very good. Staff were very good but this is a very long time to be sat on a plane. I thought I'd got bedsores on my bottom after 12 hours.

On the return flight they had moved us from a pair to the 3 seats in the middle. They didn't bother telling us so we only found out on the plane! Staff said our seats had problems with the entertainment system (it probably bored itself to death!). A lady then sits in our original seats, tries both and watched the screen in both until she put her feet up and slept. Staff chose to ignore my complaints. My lamb shank was not bad on the flight but the rest of the meal wasn't great agan. Breakfast was all but inedibl and the calzone snack was like eating a brick. The plane again was ok generally but when the best thing on the entertainment is a repeat of the Repair Shop, no sport very few games, lots of Hitchcock films...17 hours becomes a very long time.

After we got back we received a survey from Qantas which I filled in appropriately finishing by saying ' if this is qantas' flagship service then Qantas management should hang their heads in shame!' not that they'll ever read it.

You can get better service and value for money from most major airlines and a couple of hours at Singapore or Doha can be very pleasant and lets you stretch your legs. Qantas do not deserve our support, awful customer service from a major airline.",December 2022,3,4,1,1,1,4,4,1
1,Worst experience,"My first trip to Australia and Qantas made it a nightmare. I understand that there might be delays due to maintainance and other things but atleast the airlines should take responsibility and compensate the customers. Because of the delay with Qantas arriving at Sydney airport( 1 hr 30 min delay), I couldn’t catch my domestic flight to Brisbane and Qantas showed no sympathy nor compensated us. There service manager at the domestic terminal showed no respect whatsoever and shewed us away from the counter. Won’t travel with Qantas again. In addition, I had a pregnant wife and 5 year old wee one who wasn’t overly happy with the whole experience.

1,First and last time I will ever use them,"Whatever you do, do not EVER fly with Qantas. They lost my bag on the other side of the world and then let it sit in the airport for days (known by me due to an AirTag) but they did not even confirm my bag had arrived in the country, they didn’t check it in online, they didn’t tell me anything on the phone and told me I had to wait to be contacted. I couldn’t contact the airport staff and left endless voicemails. My bag was due to be delivered to me the next day and three days later I had moved accommodation so it would never have been delivered as I had no way of changing the delivery address or contacting them. I went back to the airport at my own cost after having to buy more emergency supplies (given I was only due to be without it for a day) and it took 3 hours for them to give me my bag which was literally on the other side of a wall on a trolley. There were no staff at the airport or desks open. A manager treated me appallingly after begrudgingly coming down to see me (I was in tears with stress and frustration at this point). Eventually a lady walked past by chance and after around 45 minutes to an hour bought out my bag which had not even been put through customs.

I am now five months into a complaint following and when they finally realised they were to blame, not another airline - two they have tried to blame on multiple occasions (including one that I didn’t even fly with), I’ve received the same template email for the third time. It took them over two months to respond to one email and I am now looking to take legal action.

My second experience was an internal flight within Australia which was significantly delayed and we were not kept up to date and the compensation was 15 AUD to spend on a smoothie in the airport.

I will never use them again and would not recommend Qantas to anyone. This debacle ruined the first part of my trip and has caused me no end of stress since.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Customer service doesn't know how to assist.,"I had made a booking to fly to South Africa from Auckland. I had multiple tabs open because I was trying to find the best flight and mistakenly booked the wrong dates 10 minutes after the booking was made I had called and asked to change dates to which the lady informs me is going to be an extra $2000 difference and then advised me that it would be best to take a refund. After confirming that the refund would only take a week to process I agreed. It's been 15 days, and I called back only to be told if it hasn't been processed in a week then it'll take up to 4 weeks. I mean if I had known that earlier I could've changed dates to find a more suitable time to fly back out where the difference wasn't so expensive. The guy helping me on the phone was literally a robot who just repeated the same thing over and over again and after me saying if I had know it would take 4 weeks I could have changed dates decided to go silent and then proceed to tell me the same thing again. Just based off this experience alone I'd never recommend flying with them, I'd rather fork out the bit extra and fly with Emirates like I usually do.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Delayed flights followed by poor customer service,"1st leg delayed by 45 minutes meaning missing connection flight. Considering 1st flight in the morning, clear skies no excuses. 5 hours of my holiday spent sitting in an airport. Staff provided no accountability, just passed onto Fiji Airways who were great.

Surprise surprise the return flight was also delayed.

1,Upgraded Seats Booked and Purchased but taken away by QANTAS,"Booked early to choose seats and paid extra to upgrade to exit row for additional legroom. Confirmed by QANTAS with receipt for additional charges. Booking ref 5O8ZX9 .. just in case anyone at QANTAS reads this and follow up.

24 Hour check in found seats had been changed to regular seats at back of plane. No explanation or apology or offer to refund additional costs !

TERRIBLE call centre experience when we tried to sort this out:
1. JOY - advised flight went DIRECT Sydney to London with no stops so we cannot have been issued 2 seat numbers (flight actually goes via Singapore with brief transit stop & plane change). Hung up when we explained there is a stop ....
2. RAVEN - took all details then hung up .......
3. NOX - initially offered to add note to booking to ""try"" to have this fixed at airport when we drop bags. Advised call centre staff cannot access seating details and recommended we take receipts, proof of payment for upgrades and have it sorted at airport.",April 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Gone downhill,"We had a flight from our home regional airport (which was cancelled the night before) and then got bumped from the Brisbane-Sydney Business Class leg (once again the night before flying) and could only offer us an earlier flight when we wouldn’t have even been in Brisbane! We eventually got it sorted and flew Economy!

On the way back (Sydney-Brisbane) they ran out of food on Business Class and could only offer us a toasted cheese sandwich! Should have flown Economy!

Pièce de resistance – they lost our luggage - only one bag arrived and not the other which were checked in at the same time. The bag eventually showed up at 10pm that night but they were unable to deliver it to the Airport hotel we were staying at.

A real shame that Qantas has dropped the bundle!",January 2023,-1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1
4,Decent Service and Decent Flights,"I had 2 flights for this trip, first, a 17 hour flight from London to Perth, second, a 5 hour flight from Perth to Brisbane. My first flight was on time leaving, early landing in Perth, it was a very smooth flight with little turbulence and they brought round food and drinks quite a lot keeping passengers happy and full. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful and the inflight entertainment was good. My second flight was slightly delayed but this wasn't an issue for me as it landed on schedule, there was no personal inflight entertainment but I didn't expect there to be as it was a shirt haul domestic flight and they put a film on the main screen and gave out headphones to those that wanted to watch it. Again, it was a nice smooth flight without much turbulence. The only reason I have put 4 instead of 5 is because towards the end of the first flight I got told that I couldn't use my inflatable travel pillow which I had been using all flight without anyone saying anything and when I said okay can I just ask why the response I got was that it was policy. I didn't mind deflating it but I was curious to know why as all other airlines allow them and they are sold in airports and I got the impression the cabin crew didn't know why either. All in all a very positive experience and I would recommend, just this one thing that stopped me giving a 5 star review.",April 2023,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5
2,No better service for more cost,"Paid extra for Qantas flight for comfort and entertainment ( hoping to have a screen for my todler). No screens, no extra service and uncomfortable seats.

1,Lost baggage and poor customer service,I travelled on a domestic flight which was only 1.5hrs flight time and arrived at 9am. They managed to send my baggage to an incorrect destination which was also a short haul domestic flight. They promptly found my bag and then put it on another flight that same day in the afternoon but that flight was cancelled. There were two more flights that departed after the cancelled flight and instead of putting my baggage on either of those flights it remained in Brisbane overnight. The next flight was then late morning the next day so I didn’t have my baggage for over 24hrs. In my baggage I had an esky bag with food and ice brick with perishable items which by the next day had to be thrown out.,January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Charging separately - double the fees,"How silly is this airline?? I bought two tickets in one transaction, and they took payment twice, once for each passenger which then triggers two separate international transaction fees by the bank. I called them and asked about it, and they said it's the bank's fault. I questioned why even though it is one transaction, one bill, one flight, and one total amount, they chose to charge individually per passenger? And they had no answer, it's just something that they do. So what if I were to fly all 5 of my family members, they would charge 5 times separately per passenger, and it would then trigger 5 separate international transaction fees?!",April 2023,2,2,2,1,1,3,2,2
1,Our 20th wedding anniversary has just been ruined by Qantas. 10.30am flight to Thailand cancelled at 10pm the night befo,"Our 20th wedding anniversary has just been ruined by Qantas. 10.30am flight to Thailand cancelled at 10pm the night before Good Friday. Next flight is over 8 hours later and requires we overnight in Singapore.
I have a disability so trying to find a suitable hotel at such short notice during school holidays is a nightmare. We’ve lost a night of prepaid accomodation in Thailand, paid for dog boarding for a night not now required. That aside, plans for our vow renewal ceremony are now in tatters as we effectively lose 2 days of our break.

1,Atrocious Service,"Qantas changed my flight time so I miss a connection in Dallas. No assistance was offered apart from telling me to return to the booking agent who want to chargé $60 to reissue a connecting flight ticket.

An absolute disgrace",April 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Absolutely disgusted with Qantas.,They had a plane issue since Monday and waiting til Thursday to take it out of action..Received a text advising flight delay only received once at airport. Delayed 8 hours and then waiting til nearly boarding to advise us plane is being replaced from New Zealand but not til 6pm. Lack of communication from Qantas.

Just before boarding we were told inflight entertainment system to our seats was not working and there were no alternative seats. Only thing they offered us was $100 wine voucher each but we had to be frequent flyer members , so we joined.For some reason Qantas has the wrong phone number on my husbands account so we cannot sign into it to claim the wine voucher which now has run out, by the way my husband uses my number. We have not resolved this as we are still waiting for a proper responce from Qantas. The flight home, the entertainment was working, the unit where screen comes up was broken but had black tape on it as a fix, my screen was filthy with stuff on it that you ( if you wanted) could scratch off. I had the scramled egg and bacon breakfast which can only be descrbed as sloppy mush even the bacon. I certainly did not expect this in premium econemy.

Everytime i call they say it will be ticketed in 24 hours, and nothing happen.

They took the payment right away.

This is just the last of the incident i had with this company.

Calling the call center takes often several hours and if you manage to take the line there's not much these people can do.

I will never again use their service Qantas/Jetstar and would encourage anyone not to give their money to these people.",April 2023,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,2
1,Business Class Lounge Delhi Airport !,"Couldn't find the business class lounge at Delhi International Airport even though we asked at other lounges ( Air India, Emirates). Eventually someone told us it was in an Irish pub ! In disbelief we located the pub and indeed this was where we were meant to be. The pub offered free meals - burgers and chips being the main item. I ordered a soup but that never arrived. There was no wine at the bar, just liquor and beer. The music was loud and overpowering, competing with two tv screens. We thought at least we would only be there an hour. However a Qantas official told us before we left that the flight had been delayed 30 minutes. Unable to put up with the pub a minute longer we left to go to the departure gate, where we were told the half hour delay was now one hour. Soon after the delay turned into 2 hours, then 3. Most people left the departure lounge to get some food ( It was now 1030pm). Ok, planes get delayed for one reason or other, but we were never told the reason why. Why cannot Qantas negotiate with another airline to let business travellers into a proper lounge ! By the way, our business class seat Sydney to Kolkata took us to Hyderabad, thereafter we were put in an economy seat for 3 hours on Indigo Air economy seat to get to Kolkata. So much for paying business class prices !",March 2023,4,3,2,3,2,4,4,3

On my flight from Auckland back to Melbourne, I had the misfortune of sitting next to a person who has taken 25% of my seat. I wonder if the airline couldn't organize this a little better when checking in. Being overweight isn't a bad thing, but simply taking a piece of space away from a passenger who isn't the thinnest either can't be right. So, Qantas, think about it. And while you're already thinking, you should take a look at this breakfast. Would Qantas executives like that too? Inedible for me.

1,Qantas Check-in Chaos,"Looking to minimise wasted time checking in at Melbourne Airport, we checked in on line.
On arrival to travel, we found there was no queue for persons who had already checked in on line . So, no option but to join a 45 minute queue comprising all types of passengers (other than business or platinum ticket holders) checking in

After that experience, we will never fly with Qantas again.",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,"Changed itinerary, late flight, tight connection, be we and our bags arrived!","We used QANTAS for a number of domestic flights during a recent visit to Australia from the United Kingdom. It started off being only two flights, from Sydney to Wagga Wagga on 10 February, and from Canberra to Darwin on 12 February. However, around 8 weeks prior to our departure, the non-stop flight from Canberra to Darwin was changed to an indirect flight from Canberra to Melbourne, with a very tight connection in Melbourne for the flight to Darwin. The flights were QF1529 (6.35pm departure, and 7.45pm arrival), with connection to QF838 (8.25pm departure, and 11.15pm arrival). Our departure from Canberra was late, and with a very long walk at Melbourne Airport to reach the gate for the connection to Darwin, time was tight and the flight had almost finished boarding when we reached the boarding gate. Thankfully we were able to board, and baggage was loaded and arrived safely in Darwin.

There’s a couple of things worth noting:
1. At no point on any of our check-ins and boardings with QANTAS were we asked to show any form of identity. This is standard practice in many parts of the world, and certainly in the UK (where I live) and wider Europe.
2. There was free wifi on the flight to Darwin; it worked reasonably well.
3. There was no charging points at the seat on the Boeing 737 aircraft.
4. All passengers were served a hot meal; the cottage pie I was served was quite tasty; it was a pleasant surprise. We had expected to pay for food and beverages on this flight of nearly 4 hours.
5. The flight was fairly full, and overhead bin space was at a premium; no checks at the boarding area appeared to be made to monitor the size and volume of hand luggage passengers are carrying.

There’s choices for domestic travel in Australia. We initially choose QANTAS because of the convenience of the flight from Canberra to Darwin. We did not fly QANTAS for our flight from Darwin to Brisbane. We always monitor the options and choose the best option for us, as we hold no allegiance to QANTAS.",February 2023,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,4

allocated the last seats in the plane [backs against the wall]The seating was so tight the drop down table sat on my chest [and i'm not a big guy] The whole journey I rubbed shoulders and legs with the person alongside. The meal served was like Dog Vomit,They called it Ravioli. Qantas WAS my preferred airline but no more.",March 2023,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,1
1,No longer a great airline,"Having last flown with Qantas in 2007 we have avoided them since then as they were terrible then but as their new fares in Business Class were actually better in most cases than the opposition we decided to take the punt.
In all our previous 7 trips to the USA we have flown Air NZ business class or Virgin Business Class when they used to fly to the states.
It all started poorly for Qantas when our 10.30pm flight was delayed. We ended up leaving Brisbane after 1.30am.
Having paid a huge premium for our fares we expected that as Business Class travellers we would get what Qantas advertise and that is priority boarding. No such luck….
Every passenger was shunted thru like cattle and business class passengers were put into the queue with economy and waited inline. So much for priority…
Once on board and in my cubicle I was in no mood to eat anything so asked the flight attendant to please make up my bed.
Went to the men’s and when I came back the bed wasn’t made but the FA told me I needed to complete the bed service myself. Seriously is this what Qantas call business class?
When we last flew Air NZ this service was carried out with a smile: was prompt and the bed itself was much more comfortable and larger than that provided by Qantas.
With our return flight imminent I can only hope that Qantas will finally take heed of the poor reviews and get their act together.
At this point they can only aspire to provide the same level of service that Air NZ do and having waited 16 years to fly with them after our return flight it is unlikely we would use them again.
Travel Business Class at your own peril with Qantas",March 2023,3,2,3,1,2,3,1,2
1,Qantas lack of care & unprofessional to the point of embarrassing itself as a service.,"I'd now stand firm and totally not recommend flying with Qantas.
All 4 suitcases to the total family lost and getting any type of human that is not reading off a script is next to impossible.

So far 4 days without cases and no fresh clothes. More importantly no medical supplies. My wife suffered from various illnesses and meds for 48hrs put in hand luggage the rest in the suit case.

I can see my wife is struggling now as she has been with out medical for a few days.

We have just got exhausted trying to locate and get answers to our lost baggage.

I think the biggest issue here is the lack of support therefore lack of care from Qantas.

What was explained to us as a mild inconvenience of missing suitcases that would be returned the ne t day was a total "" LIE"" 4 days later you can't get an update.

Even customer services put the phone down on us when we simply asked when can someone take responsibility and deal with the issue.

Having flown to see Family regularly we have always flown Emirates. We saw the TV advert for Qantas over Christmas on tge TV in the UK.. so we gave them ago.

WHAT A BLOODY MISTAKE THAT WAS. 🥴

So right now I'm hand washing our family underware daily with a few basic items bought from Big W ( huge thanks to big W ) just so we can stay clean.

I can wholeheartedly NOT recommend ever flying with the unprofessional service that is Qantas",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Staffs was so rude asked for service 3 times did not care that passenger need to go to toilet. No smile they just want to do there job and that is it. Cancelled the flight 3 weeked before by them we have to book another flight which delay again. Guess what gone for holiday for 9 days still did not get money back. Food was worse than dog food at home. The amount of food less that we give to the spirit on the road. Please don't call beef but called spirit of beef. Pick up our phone and make us waite for 13 mins still did not answer what we want to know. Hang up the phone with out us knowing. Worse airline in the world. Use air new zealand much much better.

I was stuck abandomed at the airport alone a single female traveller

No choice but to rent a car at the airport which put me out of pocket $500.

5,Qantas Cabin Crew Kudos - Grady & Geraty,"I flew from Brisbane, Australia to Los Angeles to connect with AC flight home to YYZ on March 18 2023.
The long haul from Brisbane to LAX is 15 hours and unless you are seated in business, the flight in economy is barely tolerable. Contrary to expectations, as I booked a seat (not free) at the emergency row, the extra legroom made it comfortable and tolerable.

More importantly, I would like to give kudos to Grady whose friendly demeanor made me feel comfortable and at ease.

I was feeling somewhat stressed regarding the connection in LAX where I had to collect my baggage, check in again, etc. Grady searched out the details I needed to know and I followed his instructions and navigated my way through to the next terminal to catch my connection.
Additionally, another attendant named Geraty and Manager ( sorry I didn't catch his name) were so very lovely in alleviating my worries. These 3 lovely people represented Qantas in a manner that the corporation ought to be very proud of. I will fly with Qantas again when I am out this way.

I cannot say enough about how much they raised the bar in customer service standards. Thank you Grady, Geraty and Manager!

1,Brutal check in process,Worst check in experience I've ever had. Took almost 2 hours to check in for an international flight because they don't let you do it online. Massive line of people and there's only two flights. Then the total wait of bags was 5 kg over so I'm slapped with a $120 charge. After waiting forever to check in they won't even waive the fee. They looked at me like I was crazy for asking. Also I'm probably 10 kg lighter than the average person on the flight. If we're going to be nazis about baggage weight then maybe considering weighing all the fat people.,March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Promises from overseas phone operators they are not delivering,"During the Covid pandemic, I was promised by Qantas to have my silver member status restored after I had booked a flight that was not registered to my details. However, this has not been done, and I am now a bronze member.

Recently, I requested a new Qantas money card, and I was told it was sent on February 22nd, 2023. However, as of today (March 23rd, 2023), I have not received it, and there has been no correspondence from Qantas about this matter.

When I contacted Qantas today, I spoke with a representative named Ray, who informed me that the card has not been sent due to a data issue and that a new card cannot be provided for another two months. I am scheduled to travel overseas in two weeks and need to access my money on this card, so this delay is highly inconvenient for me.

Despite my request to speak with a manager, Ray refused to transfer me and could not explain why the card has not been delivered or why I cannot access my money. He then transferred me to the Qantas travel money department, where I spoke with Sherline, who initially claimed the card had been delivered. However, when I explained the situation, she could not provide any further assistance and transferred me to another department, where the call was disconnected.

A cannot access my own money as they have not provided a replacement Qantas Money card.",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Their motto 'we have you money and don't care'.,"Having had a touch of anxiety at Bangkok when Qantas staff could not find my online visa for Australia, I hoped that was a glitch and life would get easier. Not with Qantas. Our luggage was left on the tarmac at Sydney. We had photos of our luggage on the tarmac from a fellow traveller and showed baggage services in Auckland. With a dozen flights a day between the two cities and only 3 hours fly time we imagined it would be a simple problem to resolve. Our baggage was collected by us after a diversion back to our original hotel after 5 days. No contact from Qantas, phones not answered, online tracking not updated, all emails requesting payment of our claim for clothing and toiletries for the 5 days have been returned. Not a care about customers is their ethos.",February 2023,4,2,2,1,1,2,1,3
3,Airline has IT issues,"We used a travelagent to make the reservations. Qantas doen'st like travel agents and will not provide internet services to make even simple changes. I was unable to check-in on line unable to request a wheel chair or a special meal unless I consulted the Travel Agent or made the change last minute at the Airport.
The day of the flight I was told I din't have reservations. When I contacted the Travel Agent Qantas had changed the record locator. The record locator is the only way to find the reservations on-line unlike other airlines.
On-board service was good. Not sure why they serve breakfast just before a 4 p.m. arrival.
I took several qantas flights in most cases arrival was on time but delayed because the gate was not available.",March 2023,4,3,4,3,3,4,1,3
1,Pathetic - no communication and no interest,"Qantas lost our (and others bags). They delivered one bag 5 days later and the second 18 days later (when we were back in UK).
Since then they ignored everything. 3 customer complaint references have been given. We have been back 3 weeks and all Qantas have done is aske for the same information that has been given at least 5 times, repeatedly and have not even formally apologies for losing the luggage....trying to get the basic level of refunds for the limited amount of expenses incurred (laundry for the existing clothes, toiletries and phones calls) seems impossible. If the flight was in the Europe we could have hammered them, but because it is from a 3rd world country from which they originate, well...",February 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,I hate Qantas and I'm not alone,"Qantas just do not give a sh*t about its customers anymore. I have been a Qantas Club member and semi regular flyer since Jan 2005.

I had a business overnight flight Bangkok to Syd. I was first customer at the check in desk but I was advised that my allocated seat was broken and could not move or recline. I couldnt understand how every single other seat could be allocated when I was first person to check in (surely not every other bus class passenger has done seat selection online?). Anyway I was offered 500USD as compensation, and given a voucher. Not really adequate for an expensive flight but anyway ...

Worst part is I have called Qantas

22/11/22
13/2/23
13/3/23
16/3/23
20/3/23

and still no refund payment or even progress on the matter, I never get called back as promised and there is no email corrospondence avaliable. Their systems are setup to fail.

Qantas have really turned me into a ""I hate Qantas"" flyer and now I do everything in my power to aviod Qantas. Unfortunately in Australia other choices are somewhat limited.",November 2022,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,3
2,Very disappointing,"Suboptimal customer service.
Tiny meals left us hungry.

Operating like a budget airline at a PREMIUM cost.
Would not recommend",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,worst airline ever,"changed my flight couple of times, and I had to stay in Singapore with my kids overnight, now denying all the record that they have promised with the accomodation and meal allowances, people, just avoid this airline",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,"Dirty aircraft, near black seat.","Clean your aircraft. Steam clean or replace. The seat was filthy, to the point of disgusting. The lavatories had not been cleaned. The decline in this once great airline is appalling. Staff are great, management stinks!",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Excellent level of serived,"From the moment we got on the aircraft until we got off the staff made us feel welcome and were ambassadors for the airline.

We booked the seats with the additional legroom by the wing emergency exit and worth the extra fee, just if you get someone who likes to roam around in the dark, as we did, she kept bumping into me and kicking my feet, continuously.

I had the gluten free option for the meals and they were all very nice.

First time in doing the non-stop flight and it was brilliant.

Thank you Qantas",March 2023,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5
2,Declined in service and quality,"I used to consider Qantas to be one of the quality airlines but not after this experience. The food was absolutely awful - so bad we did not eat any of the ""'slop"" served on the trans-Tasman or flight from Sydney to Singapore. On the return we opted to eat at the airport to avoid the on-board and were glad we did when we saw to same disgusting meals served to other passengers. The staff who have never been the top in airlines standings but were mostly good, were completely disinterested. The experience in Sydney airport on the return - when our delayed QF2 meant a very tight connection to the Queenstown flight was dismal. Staff on board said not to worry - the flight would wait. A small number of passengers managed to get onto the onward flight - which was then dispatched without the rest of us or anyone's bags on-board! Try to find someone to help - not possible. One staff member at the gate did provide assistance but also admitted there was a disconnect in information as to to what was supposed to happen - and even she did not know. Very poor standards and an airline relying on the Aussie governments pockets to keep in business - not good.",March 2023,1,3,3,1,2,4,4,1
5,Qantas Saved my Cruise/Holiday.,"Having flown from Newcastle to Heathrow with BA on my sons passport passport by mistake I arrived at the Heathrow check in desk to go onto Auckland New Zealand.
It was no surprise that the check in desk would not allow me to fly until I had my own passport which happened to be 200 miles away at home. Qantas staff ( S.M ) in particular arranged our flights to take place the next day free of charge which was transported down by my family. Even when we went the next day ( S.M ) came to see us before we boarded the next days flight to make sure everything was OK. We missed one day in Auckland but still managed to get our cruise in time. Cant thank the checkin personnel at Heathrow enough.",February 2023,2,2,4,4,4,4,5,3
1,Still waiting for refund,"It’s been over a year, Qantas has made a $1B profit by neglecting their customers and using cheap, unqualified labour in all aspects of the business and we are still waiting for our $400 (chump change to Joyce) refund after multiple phone calls, many hours of stress and 3 times being assured that the refund was transferred (probably hoping we would shut up and go away). Our flight home was cancelled on the tarmac due to engine failure (so much for their doctored mechanical failure stats) they obviously kept the same food as it tasted revolting. We haven’t flown with them since and are reluctant to in the future.",April 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,DOnt fly if you want your luggage to come too,"We got this flight to Bangkok...but our luggage didnt (at least one other couple had the same surprise on landing!). We went through the normal , lost luggage ""fun"" at Bangkok airport (filled out forms explained when and where etc and gave our Bangkok address for the luggage to be delivered too, once Qantas decided to send it out.....
1 piece of luggage arrive 5 days later, the second made it Bangkok the day after we flew home (16 days late). We had to go and buy stuff (underware, toiletries, medicien sun cream etc) and pay for the taxxi to collect our luggage from teh airport!
In the mean time I mad over 19 calls to the ""no helpline with little success and emailed and raised complaints.. none have which have had any response.
I even emailed the CEO - the day after they announced a record profit for the quarter - but he is obviously too busy helping shareholders to worry about customers!
A complete show or....Dingos.
So I have my luggage, at home and receipts and bills for the ""fun"" Qantas caused but as yet no contact and no clear process of how to get a refund for the money spent...we want even talk about compensation for ruining the holiday (and my Wife's birthday!)",February 2023,2,3,4,1,1,4,4,3
5,Amazing Customer Service,Was offloaded from QF009 due to not feeling well was a little stressed but ground staff for Qantas were amazing and got my bag off the flight up to the counter then checked it back in and got me another flight from Melbourne to Perth I was so grateful for everything that they all did which helped ease my stress definitely will continue to fly with an reputable company highly recommend to A++++,March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Flight was fine, but train your airport staff","We missed our flight because no one bothered to help us with our luggage issues.
All the Qantas airport staff would say is that they couldn't do anything.
What good are you then? They looked so disinterested and couldn't wait to fob us off. If your job is customer service, least act like you're interested in helping your customers.

The only time we got assistance was when Australia Border police helped us, and they had to look over the Qantas staff's shoulders to get them to do their job.

The Qantas staff promised we would get our luggage in the next airport, and gave us a luggage claim ticket, but when we got to Wellington, our luggage wasn't there. The ticket was just to get rid of us. We would have lost our luggage if it wasn't for a non-Qantas Melbourne airport staff who called us and put our luggage on another flight.

We will never fly Qantas again, and will not recommend them to any of our friends.",February 2023,2,2,3,1,1,3,1,2
5,Great crew,"Qantas 717 cabin crew were so lovely. Very professional and friendly too. The plane is a little older but this will be upgraded to the A220 soon. Which then Alliance maybe taking over these type of routes.
The flight even though it was short was pleasant, we boarded early and arrived early.

I fly multiple times every week and never really have issues.

You have to remember they have hundreds of flights every day, the reviews that are negative are usually the ones that get posted. There are many more positive experiences that don’t get added.

We were provided with free drinks and snacks, crew handed out chocolates after service which was a nice touch. Free beer and wine on evening flights was great.

Thank you QantasLink",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Multiple failures on a series of flights,"Upgraded to business this being a longer flight, but there is no meaningful difference, either in seat size nor food and drinks. Staff at boarding were very offhand. Flight crew slightly better. Ground staff were provided by an agency who were very slow.",February 2023,3,3,4,3,2,3,1,1
1,Very poor customer service,"Booked with British Airways but connecting flight from Singapore was with Qantas. Flew business class but luggage lost in transit. Woman on Qantas desk rude and unhelpful. People at the call centre on the number I was given to phone had no more information than the website which simply said that my cases were being searched for. No one could even tell me if my cases had made it onto the flight from Heathrow. Eventually arrived 3 days later….
Talking to others I gather my story is not unusual.
Qantas have made large profits this year but until there is mandatory financial compensation for delayed luggage, nothing will change. We as customers can only vote with our feet-I will NEVER fly Qantas again…..",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,All 5 flights got cancelled without reason. Rescheduled flight required a visa. To solve it they charged extra 820AUD,"Qantas canceled the flights. They provided only one alternative option requiring a visa. When I pointed it out, they charged an extra 820AUD to have a rescheduled flight without a visa requirement. But they lost my other tickets. I was trying to persuade them for two hours until I got my tickets back. But these flights were canceled again. You can't speak with someone in Melbourne airport. They say to call the hotline and wait for an hour until a rude operator will refuse to solve this issue",July 2022,3,3,3,1,1,3,1,3
1,Utterly dissapointed!,"I have not taken my flight yet. It was scheduled form the summer of 2023. I had four flights with Quantas because we are touring Australia this summer. I booked a year in advance and planned every detail. Every flight with them has been changed by the airlines. One flight dropped the second leg of our trip. To make a long story short, I had to cancel everyflight and book with someone else. I had to change transfers, accomadations and exursions due to limited new options. To make it worse, I am now fighting for my refunds, $1000's is now on my credit card due to the delay in refunds. This company is horrible and can not be trusted. I have spend countless hours trying to get their mess fixed.",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Used to be the best now focused on profits,They don't respond to that customer enquiries I've heard many issues with the ticket no one can help even as gold frequent flyer. That customer service is there to lie to our customers and hope they don't continue to follow up. Absolutely disgusting. Are used to be proud to be a frequent flyer with this airline.,January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,OLD FASHIONED FRIENDLY SERVICE,"My partner and I are both walking cane dependent and the wonderful Qantas cabin crew of the 737 to Nadi on Feb 26th went out of their way to help make our trip to Fiji all the more special. The food was enjoyable, the flight was seamless (Nicole in particular) greeted us with a very welcoming manner. Thank you Qantas for being the best!",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,The worst experience ever,"My company booked a flight from Kuala Lumpur to London via Singapore. The KL- Singapore flight was provided by Jet Air , who arrived late but I was insured that the Qantas flight would wait in case there is some delay and passengers to London would be transferred directly to the gate. To our shock the airport assistant announced that the London flight is not boarding anymore and everybody would be transferred to the hotel , but the plane hasn’t departed yet. We rushed to the gate , have gone through the security just to find out the plane is not accepting connecting passengers due to some internal regulations, even though we arrived before the official departure. The obnoxious Qatar gentleman didn’t really care about asking the captain to wait for us. We went to hotel where we were offered 30 Singapore dollars meal a day and a room in a smoky room. I have spent whole night with Qantas call centre who were completely useless and couldn’t move me to another plane this of the following day. Overall the experience was appalling, the service was pathetic and inhumane. The lack of any empathy from Qantas will make me think twice before booking any new flight with this airline in the future.",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Not worth paying additional,"Disappointed with cabin crew attitude, their body language(I'm gonna do the basics, that's it).
My seat did not recline, 2 of them "" flight attendants"" (being asked separately) said ""I'll have a look"" they didn't. Best say: sorry your seat hasn't been serviced, nothing we can do.
The beverages team didn't even bother to say what wines were available. It doesn't cost anything to say "" I have only chardonnay and shiraz"". I asked for ice on my plastic cup: the male steward said"" I don't have ice?
He was away 20 steps from getting ice...but he couldn't be bothered. Better fly Jetstar, paying LESS for similar service.",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Amazing lack of care for inconvenience to passengers,"Our delayed international flight resulted in us missing our connecting domestic flight additional 6 hour layover at Sydney Airport. I understand this sometimes happens, but the level of poor customer service and lack of care factor was surprising.",March 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Lost baggage terrible customer service,"A simple non-stop flight from AKL to SYD result in Qantas managing to lose baggage.
After multiple calls and baggage not being located for 3 days they said that we may purchase some clothes and submit receipt through their website to claim back the expense. This was done, and then nothing is heard from Qanats for 3+ weeks. A follow up phone call to Qantas so called customer service line (wait time 20 mins to get through) would not allow me to speak to the baggage department to get me an update, instead they put me on hold for several minutes and then the same lady told me they had ""expedited"" my query. When I asked what this meant and when I could expect a response, I was told, as soon as possible. When I probed this for her to actually give me a time line she would not do it, I asked if I could expect the query to be resolved this year, she couldn't even give me that assurance.
I paid a bit more to go with Qantas to have a premium experience, this has truly backfired and wish I had gone with Air NZ/Singapore for my full trip instead, hell even AirAsia would have been better!",February 2023,2,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
5,Friendly and cordial,"Customer service is an art. It comes from the heart. And Qantas, your employees are mastered in that. Thank you Qantas for such a friendly and homley experience during the flight and also at the airport. Thank you Qantas for welcoming me, regardless of my skin colour and passport identity. That was my first experience in 12 years of flying with 13+ Airlines. And last but not least, thank you Qantas for breaking the stereotype that cabin crews should be the slim young human beings with 20 mm thickness make up and an artificial smile. You are showing the world that Cabin crews come in any age, form and shape. That years of experience of them are making you extra special. And their friendly, respectfull behavior from the heart is your identity.

Thank you

1,"Booked Business Class with Qantas Titanium card, Disaster follows","So we tried to book business class from Brisbane to Dublin (Ireland) with our Qantas Titanium card. First Qantas said we would have to book two seperate booking as they can't book non-Qantas flights with Titanium cards! We said that would be fine as long as our luggage could be checked all the way through. They said yes. As it turns out when we called back to confirm, they said its not possible and that we would have to re-check in our luggage at London (Heathrow), even though the connecting flight Qantas booked for us won't allow us enough time to do that connection (While getting our luggage again) - Side note: I can book this all online with zero issues, but Qantas Titanium concierge makes you call to utilise the benefits of the card. We have tried now 6 calls to rectify the issue and at the very least get a flight that allows us to collect our bags on London and make it to the connecting flight. We have been hung up on 3 times. 1 person said they would call us back and nothing and all for the pleasure of $12,000 in flights and $1200 in fees for a Qantas Titanium card. #flyemirates",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

We travel Auckland-Manila with layover in Sydney on the 22nd of December 2022, and until now one of our check in baggage is still not located and its more than 2 months now.! We check in 2 baggage and the one was delivered last feb.19 around 5am early in the morning without any call or update for the deilvery. The worst thing are the baggage padlock is been cut and tampered and they even put it inside, the zipper is almost broken and heaps of our stuffs is been stolen, as per weigh of our baggage it is mire 26 kilao but before opening the baggage and they weigh in it was only down to 24 kilos.! We keep calling the given baggage customer service number but no one is picking up our call.! Both in manila ang here in new zealand.! I kept sending them an email but no one is replying me and assist me in my lost baggage report and query.! I only got generated automatic reply from them.!
We spent our hard earned money on all the contains of our bag.! We pay a more than a 5,000nzd for a one way ticket for me and my husband which is way too expensive for a plane ticket just to experience this inefficient and unprofessional services.!
If there is any one who can helps to sue this airline for our lost baggage please help and please advise.!

5,Exceptional Service,"I recently flew with Qantas from Brisbane to Perth with my elderly grandmother (86years). The service produced by the airhostesses has been nothing short of exceptional. They did their upmost to ensure she was comfortable for the entire duration of the flight even to the point They offered her some of their food as she wasn't impressed with the meal she was served. They then even made the effort to help her get to and from the bathroom.
We knew travelling with Nan was going to be a challenge due to her lack of mobility but the air hostesses went above and beyond for us and made the trip so much more enjoyable than we had first anticipated. Thank you specifically to Flo, Ali, Amanda and Jasmine.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Jetlag not as bad as non direct flights to Australia.",February 2023,4,3,5,5,3,4,4,5
2,The safest worst airline,"No doubt this is the safest airline but the airline crew are so bossy and angry. Not even a smile or being kind. Cabin crew so not feeling welcome on board. Have been on some many airlines before, this is the worst! And of course, the food in a long haul flight, nothing to remember! Give it a try to fly on one of Europe's!",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Worst airline in Australia,"Hands down the worst airline in Australia. Spirit of Australia? Only if Australia is the scum on the bottom of your shoe. The service experienced over 5 flights since the beginning of 2023 has been consistently the worst in the country. Not only is customer service at the check in counter horrendous, but the flight attendants themselves are also the rudest people you've met. On my Brisbane to Port Moresby flights earlier in Jan 2023, they had delays in check-in for over 2.5 hours! All because Qantas decided to reduce staff and switch to an automated check-in system that didn't work and relied on the 5 staff members around to run about helping EVERY customer. Then on my trip back from Nadi to Brisbane through Sydney, I could have easily made my connection but unfortunately I made the misjudgement of going with the ""seamless transit"" service instead of just taking the free airport bus shuttle. They told me I could not make my 2pm flight because the transit desk needed 1 WHOLE hour for domestic connections. So then they booked me onto the 4pm flight, which didn't depart until 5pm! So by the time I reached Brisbane, I was also stuck in peak hour traffic that further delayed my return home. In total, I was delayed by 5 hours with no apology or compensation for my time, only rude service. What a ridiculous excuse for an airline, and claiming to be the national airline of Australia, you bring shame to us all!!!",February 2023,3,3,3,1,-1,1,1,4
1,Failed 5 times in 1 flight,"Qantas failed at every step of the way:
1. Flight was cancelled - leaving us stranded without airport transport
2. Replacement flight added a stop over - extra 90min of travel
3. Replacement flight was delayed
4. Connecting flight (from added stop over) was missed - extra hour of travel
5. Lost half of our luggage",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1
1,Worst customer service ever experienced,"(Missing case) I flew from Sydney to Manila with Qantas on 24/02/2023. When my partner and I arrived in Manila, there was no sign of one of our cases. It seems that the lady at checkin never checked one of our bags on properly as there are only 3 of 4 bags listed on our receipt, although we handed over 4. We have been trying to get an answer since Friday, we called, we sent several emails, we sent reports, we spoke to live bots, to no avail. We are moving country and all of our belongings are in this case. We are just trying to get an answer and no one is giving it to us. The service has been appalling since we landed at checkin at the Qantas gate of Sydney airport. Staff are just extremely rude and unhelpful! This is supposed to be Australia’s #1 airline?? I have received much better service from budget airlines. Absolute joke. I would strongly advise against choosing this airline.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Will never be flying qantas again,"I have flown qantas twice in the last 6 months and both times have been terrible - the planes are dirty and seats are damaged or falling apart, the food is mediocre to say the least every flight I have been travelling on has been delayed and or late on arrival with poor communication and reasoning as to why.

Will not recommend to fly with Qantas to anyone well below average service & planes very poorly equipped compared to a competitor carrier e.g Air Nz (much smaller airline) asked for a blanket and was told we didnt load those on but clearly see upper class passengers being served them.

Would much rather pay a higher fare price and avoid them at all costs!!",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Awful seat allocation for travellers with babies under 2.,"While I understand bassinet seating is limited. Qantas does not warn users with child bookings that the seat is not in a bassinet row. I had booked seats 25k and 25J (A330-200) which appeared to be the first row directly behind business class, it appears the aircraft has been changed and now the seats are no longer in the spot we expected them to be in. I called the Qantas number on two occasions and was not assisted to rectify this issue. No attempted to rectify the issue and make our travel a lot more comfortable. I have also been informed while on the calls mentioned above, Qantas does not provide airline prams/strollers for use between check-in and boarding the flight.

Platinum status has proven not to be useful. My partner and I have no faith in Qantas and have decided to book with a different airline on our return trip and future trips.",February 2023,3,3,3,1,1,3,2,3
1,Terrible Refund Service,"5 months ago I changed my return flight from London to Sydney.
I downgraded my seat from premium economy to economy due to the change of return flight. I was informed I would receive $127 refund for the difference in ticket.
5 months later after multiple phone calls, written complaints, supplied statutory declarations I am waiting. One person tells me I should get it in 14 business days and the next person has no idea of this. You cannot contact the refund team as they do not have a ""contactable number"".
Overall I am appalled in the service provided and will not be flying ever again with them.",February 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1,"Imagine a flight company can’t even manage the system and staff well, how can people trust their planes work?","The quality of the consumer service is extremely poor, been calling every single day in a week for changing the date, but those agents kept providing mistaken information for the process and the price. You know what the most funniest thing is? Here we come. 4 different prices I have been told to pay for the same thing by 4 different agents. Every single time after the agents process my payment, I received an email informing me the payment is failed . I am very sure there must be something wrong with their system and their staff.

Imagine a flight company can’t even manage the system and staff well, how can people trust their planes work?

If I were you, I would never choose a flight company like Qantas with poor management and potential management problems in the future.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Never again,"Apart from the luxury of a flat bed, I do not believe that after paying $8,500 return for a business class seat was value for money.
I have traveeled in business class on Quantas previously and the food and the service was good.
This last trip, the food was appaling, threre was nos ervice as after the lights were dimmed the cabin crew disappeared, and I had to walk to the back of econnomy class to find a flight attendant to provide me with some water.
The food was dreadful. Neil Perry mat have designed the menu but it was awful. I had a piece of steak which was parctically bouled dry and later a panini with chicken and dressing, the panini was so dry it was curling up, and the filing was non existent .
I will not waste any more money flying with Quantas.",January 2023,4,4,4,1,1,1,4,1

I received a text message on 19th February asking me to check in via the Qantas website. When I tried to do so on the webpage using my booking reference. However, it said that I needed to go to the airport to check in.
On Feburary 19th, I went to the Wellington airport. Two employees working for the contractor company that works for Qantas at the airport tried to provide me with my tickets. However, they were told by the ticketing department that my flights had been voided. The person in the ticketing department claimed the flight had been voided by American Airlines, their partner airline. On 1 December I was surprised to receive a partial refund of around 177NZD, a fraction of the approx. 1705 NZD I had paid for the flights. This made no sense as I had asked Qantas several times via email and over the phone to specify what the refund was for in November 2022 without receiving an answer from them. In November I had asked them to change my flight date and paid them to process this request. On February 19th, I was asked to call the Qantas hotline as the employees at the airport were unable to help me. To my disbelief the hotline staff told me that they would not reissue the tickets nor provide a full refund.
I absolutely do not recommend this airline. If you want to make any changes to your flight dates be prepared to spend hours on their hotline if you are flying internationally. I don't wish anyone to go through the saga I am going through with them. I am almost 2000NZD out of pocket because of the mistakes that have been made. I had to book another flight last minute, pay for an additional night at hotel, etc. This has been very stressful and expensive. I still have not received an answer from them nor a full refund and recompensation.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Expected better,"For a national airline, I expected a bit better from Qantas on my 6 hour flight from Sydney to Bali. The food service was ok, very small portion - not enough for a longer journey. The crew were friendly, and the cabin appearance and comfort was fine. However, the in-flight entertainment was AWFUL. Very limited options and hardly any films that are relatively recent, let alone new releases! At one point, I realised that many people, including myself, were watching the same film - Wakanda! During check-in, it's all self check in machines, and hardly any Qantas staff. You have to check in, print your own luggage tags, and take your bags for check in yourself - which I found to be quite cheap from the airline. Qantas also made the passengers on this flight to wear face masks. Why, I have no idea. On arrival in Bali, hardly anyone in the terminal was wearing one, so what's the point?",February 2023,4,4,1,4,3,4,3,3
2,Dreadful airline,First time I flew with Quantas and having paid £2400 return economy it was a disgrace. Having got my seat to depart which I was pleased with I was then asked to move as someone more needy needed my seat. On the plus side the staff were really nice and very willing to please. Onboard entertainment wasn't the best but definitely ok. Food was very poor both flights. Snacks not readily available unless you ask. On the return flight I had an email prior to departure advising flight was delayed. Then a further email advising flight delayed again. To their credit they did give me a $20 voucher to get food but that doesn't buy much for a delay of about three to four hours extra when you've already been their nearly three. Then to top it all the flight was delayed from Singapore to UK too which meant I missed my bus home and I couldn't get on another bus as they were full due to a train strike. So ended up waiting for 4 hours to get on a less busy bus. For the money I paid it was just chaos all round and I've since just returned back from Perth and used another airline who were fabulous and cost less than half what I paid for quantas. Unless you need a direct flight use another airline.,November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Worst airline I've ever dealt with,"You'd be better off swimming to your destination than flying with qantas.

Where to begin.. this has been the absolute worst customer service I have ever received in my life.
My girlfriend and I flew from Melbourne to auckland, we landed but the winds picked up and they were unable to get our bags off the plane. We were specifically told to fill out a paper copy of the lost baggage form and hand this in at the airport, and that we would then receive correspondence about our bags being sent to us within 7 days at the latest.

It is now day 9 and we've heard absolutely nothing. My girlfriend and I have called every number possible, Sent emails, tweets, direct messages everything but still no one has helped us.

On the 20th I spoke with someone who put the phone down on me. On the 21st I spoke with someone who told me I'd get 2 calls back within the next 24 hours, 1 about our baggage and 1 about our compensation, i received neither. I called again today and spoke with 3 separate people today on the phone, each one unable to help. Their manager REFUSED to speak to me. I was then refused the name of the manager several times.

It appears no one in this company wants to help me, let alone is capable of helping me. I have been hung up on twice, I was even left on the line whilst a consultant left the phone on silent for 15 minutes hoping I would just hang up before she had to help.

In summary, I'd advise anyone looking to fly with qantas to reconsider. They snap up your money (and luggage in my case) and then refuse to help or answer any form of contact after. Utterly disgraceful.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Service structure not thought out,"The trip to LA was OK, though the food was mediocre at best. I flew premium economy here.
On the return, I tried to change my standard seat selection and was told that even though the seat was listed as free (as was the one I was changing it from), they would charge me $45USD to change seats. I've never heard of this before on ANY airline, and it tipped me back to flying Air New Zealand again from now on. I do like the A380, but not the way Qantas run it...",February 2023,3,3,2,3,1,2,3,1
1,I was bumped off a Qantas Flight I had booked 7 months earlier,"On the day my wife and I were due to return to the UK from Perth we were “bumped off” the flight I had booked 7 months earlier. The explanation I was given was “ safety reasons “ due to weather conditions.
We were put on to an alternative flight which took off over 4 hours after our original flight and included a 2 hour stopover.Apart from the inconvenience, If we had booked this flight originally it would have cost us much less than the non-stop Qantas flight we had paid for.
I enquired about the weather conditions with the other airline that supposedly caused Qantas to remove us from the flight. They stated that they were unaware of any adverse weather conditions that day.
I lodged a complaint with Qantas. who just replied with meaningless and irrelevant “standard letters” which ruled out any real apology or offer of compensation.
I suspect that the flight was either “over sold” or took on additional cargo at the last minute. I am waiting from a response from the Australian Airline Customer Advocate .
I won’t be flying with Qantas again!",December 2022,3,-1,3,1,3,3,3,3
1,Very disappointed,"Our flight was delayed nearly 30 hours but that is not why I gave 1 star. When we eventually did get underway, the whole experience was terrible. Could hardly move in the seat. Last traveller in my seat left hair clips. We had one meal and 1breakfast on a17 hour flight. Offered water 4 times and twice came round with one chocolate sweet. I had a vodka with meal and it was the cheap stuff. I know, you could go up to the steward station and ask for beverages but on a17 hour flight surely the service could be more frequent. This was my 4th long distance flight in the last 14 months with different airlines and was the worst by a country mile.
I have also done 2 internal flights with Qantas and they were good, but there certainly should be a little consideration shown to the people who visit Australia. The first impression you get of Australia is the flight and they certainly let their country down.",February 2023,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1
1,You've been warned. Don't use Qantas for international flights,"They charged our card twice and told us they didn't receive any payments so would hold the flights for 24 hours while we called the bank, we spent 6 hours on the phone with them and our bank and the bank confirmed the payment had been approved, so when we called Qantas back the next day to give them the confirmation number and they told us they hadn't actually held the flights and instead had cancelled them. And surprise surprise the flights had gone up by $3500 in a day, how convenient.

They we're so unhelpful I'm convinced they did all this on purpose and kept saying there was nothing they could do because it was a partner airline. So I would highly recommend you book directly with whatever partner airline your traveling internationally with because we always have issues with Qantas doing this, this was just the most intensely frustrating one.

By the way Qantas, we don't want another meaningless PR response from you about how sorry you are, we've been on the phone with several of your actual customer service operators and I can tell you, you don't care so just don't reply to this ok.",January 2023,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1
1,Never again!,"I have been trying for over a year to contact Qantas. They make it impossible. They will change your booking multiple times so that it no longer makes sense, even after you've arrived at the airport. And I couldn't even use my return portion of the ticket as they had the second leg of the journey leaving before the first -- and from a completely different city! In total I've spent over 30 hours on the phone waiting for someone to pick up. There's no customer care email address. I have written multiple complaints (and requests for refunds) via the complaints and refunds pages, but no one responds. It's a disaster. And to think they have received bailouts from the Australian government using (in part) MY taxes makes me furious. They have even been boasting about turning record profits!!! Yet they can't find the time (or pay sufficient staff) to attend to the valid concerns of their customers. All they care about is money. But this is nothing new with Qantas. When their competition (Ansett) went under just over 30 years ago they instantly tripled all their prices. And they maintain the same attitude today (because they know people don't have a choice but to fly with them or their subsidiary, especially with Virgin going under). The only difference between now and then is that the quality of their service has free-fallen. I went business class and ate half-cooked rice with some unidentifiable meat. We were offered only cheap wine and beer, with no pre-flight drink. Just like economy but the food was worse. My seat and tray were filthy, obviously hadn't been cleaned in a long time, and staff super rude, lazy and not at all attentive (took almost 2 hours to get their attention. They were all huddled in the galley, gossiping. In the end, I had to sit on the dirty seat for two hours, until the seatbelt sign was off, before I was able to walk up to the galley -- they completely ignored the call bell -- and request some wipes to clean it myself). All of this is 100% truth, no exaggerations. Maybe I was just incredibly unlucky, but it's hard to believe that considering the service was consistently bad the whole way through, from beginning to end. If travelling to Australia, go with an Asian airline. They always treat customers with respect; not like annoying nuisances (and I should add, at this point, that I was never unduly demanding and I always spoke to the staff politely and with maximum understanding). Worst of all, Qantas didn't provide accommodation as promised by the staff when they changed the connecting flight to the following day at the last minute, leaving me wandering through dark and isolated car parks after midnight trying to find airport accommodation. The flight attendant probably just told me that to fob me off; she told me to go to the service desk but she must have known it was closed outside of business hours (no one at the hotels was answering and most of the hotels were fully booked. I was not allowed to stay inside the airport as it closed overnight. Such disregard for passenger safety). Really, words cannot express how shocked I was at how far Qantas has plummeted. Australia's favourite airline indeed...",March 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Amazing service and nice flight,Amazing customer service on our flight from brisbane to Melbourne particular mention to Georgie our cabin crew member made us feel warm and welcome and wanted. Highly recommend clean and top service,February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Racist airline Qantas downgraded me fromBus to economy ( while on a work trip),"I don’t know what’s with qantas and non white people, the customer service is terrible. Despite being an international ticket to Santiago, a leg of my flight Sydney was downgraded to economy. The check in counter customer service rep didn’t acknowledge or tell me the reason why I was downgraded.
I suppose qantas would have not dared to do this if my skin and hair was lighter.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,No to Qantas,"Five (5) flights in two (2) weeks- two complaints issue against Qantas. Flight cancelled resulted in extra hotel night, no reimbursement. And paid for upgrade to Econ Plus, but Qantas changed planes at the last minute and seated us in Econ.
Qantas gives you a complaint reference number quickly, but then always responds with a
Call back promise that does not happen. They just wear you down until you give up.",January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Worst airline in the world,"Do what ever you can to fly with an alternate airline.
Old and cranky stewardess is a prerequisite for Qantas. Try and book a frequent flyer flight on classic rewards. Hahahahaha. Non existent. Their frequent flyer program is so fake. If you can’t find a classic reward flight, which you won’t, you’ll be asked to used the most ridiculous amount of points for your flight. Example, close to 1 million points to fly to London from Sydney one way. That equates to spending 2 million dollars on your credit card to earn those points or flying to Bangkok on a paid flight 200 times. Hard to believe? Check it out. Don’t wast your time until Alan Joyce is gone from the top job. Every Australian I know now hates Qantas. It’s embarrassing to admit it’s our national airline. And all because of Alan. I’d rather row a boat to London.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,Nice Airlines but...,I flied from Bangkok to Auckland VIA Sydney on Qantas. The A330-300 is a nice aircraft to fly Economy since the a/c layout is 2-4-2 and the IFE was very nice! The food was great but too small portion while their crew is the best.,February 2023,4,5,5,3,4,4,5,3
1,Change of Schedule,"My flight was delayed from Friday to Saturday. Bad enough, but it was what followed that really annoyed me. I was told by email that I had to accept the new date and time, even though it was the same flight. Qantas told me I had to contact my travel agent. I spent two calls of 60 minutes with my agent who were told by Qantas that they could not do this. Phoned Qantas again - 28 minute call - seemed to know nothing and told me I had to wait. Phoned just now and was told to wait for another email from them. I don't entirely trust this and I still don't feel entirely confident about being on the flight. Stress

I had to cancel my Melbourne hotel, but it was the totally confused messaging and communication that inspired me to write this. Avoid Qantas.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Refund still not issued after 2 years,"After my flight was canned due to Covid in 2020, we were issued with 'Flight Credit'. Upon trying to have this refunded, we've been given the run-around for over a year. Customer service either don't care, or don't know. Refund requests go ignored, incorrect information is constantly relayed to us - some go as far as saying previous agents have 'lied' about the status of our claim. I cannot and will not recommend Qantas to anyone.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,Food provided was worst I had in any airlines. Crew members were rude tired and overloaded with work. Qantas is totally avoidable for international travel.,December 2022,4,3,2,1,1,1,4,1
1,Avoid if you can,"Qantas cancelled our flight two years ago and still has not refunded us the hundreds of dollars in excess baggage we paid for. I've spoken to them about this many times, and they don't deny they owe us the money; they just say someone will get back to us about it, and no one ever does.

Any time I phone they say they have no record of any of the hours and hours I've spent on the phone with them before, and need all the information again. If I have a reference number from the last call, when I call again they say the number doesn't refer to anything and they have no record of the case. The worst customer service I've ever encountered, and it's cost us money we couldn't spare - but they really don't care. Avoid at all costs.",March 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1
1,Hotel accomodation.,"Qantas couldn't even get a hotel booking right. The manager in Dubbo luckily rang to decode the Qantas stuff up. They were also holding my credit so no, can't pay for accomodation with that. I will never travel Qantas again so there goes the credit.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Be careful, smiles on the outside, selfish on the inside!","My elderly unwell mother in law arrived at airport and was told she has been downgraded from Business to Economy on a long haul flight. Four months later still no refund and unable to communicate with Qantas. Lodged for matter to be heard at Civil tribunal, Qantas turned up with no intention to resolve the matter. They argued that the court doesnt have jurisdiction over Qantas. What has happened to this ""great Australian company"". Surely it time for changes at the top. When is enough, enough!! Please people of Australia and Qantas customers, I urge you not to put up with the state of Qantas!! This is written with regret by a previously loyal and loving customer..:(",October 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
3,Hand Luggage Allownce,"Hi
I’ve booked a flight through Expedia but it states there is no hand luggage allowed on the return flight. Has anyone experienced this before ? ( I am allowed hand luggage on the outgoing flight)

The concern is how to bring back my power bank. Can I put this in my pocket ?",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Bag damaged 8 months ago, still not sorted out the replacement.","We had one of our bags badly damaged on a flight in June 2022 and contacted Qantas customer care. After a few emails and pictures they sent us an email in July 2022 staying the replacement bag has been ordered and we will receive it shortly. After 7 months and many emails to Qantas I have no replacement bag and not a single reply from them.
I called the booking line today and the lady there did a bit of digging and found out my case had been closed and she cannot look into it, she advised me to open a whole new case and reference my old case number.
So I started the process all over again, maybe it might get sorted before 2024.
Qantas is a joke and I hate having to fly with them now. We need more airlines to make them wake up and sort out their customer service, or lack of it.

3,Lunch time food service,"My husband & I took QF 735 From Sydney-Adelaide/1way cost $610 pp at 11:05am 4/2/2023 after arrived from a cruise ship. The flight was late. By the time they served lunch was about 12pm.
We were horrified lunch was just a piece of cake & coffee/drinks. For $610 pp. You would have thought a hot lunch or so....... Cutting cost by charging high fare but no decent food service... We think It is unexceptable and quite poorly.
We rarely travel economy unless we have to. Qantas needs to shake up the food dept. Reputation is very important if the CEO cares??

But we had to say the 3 gethlemen flight attendants, they were so polite, professional, attentive & outstanding service. They are our highlights 10/10 for them.

We caught morning Virgin business class from Adelaide to Sydney for only $559 pp 2weeks prior. Thump up for Virgin.",February 2023,3,4,4,5,1,3,3,1
3,Food terrible,"Qantas, lift your game!!! Your food on the flight was terrible. No imagination, variety or care went into those disgusting meals. Not hard to get it right. This is not the first time I have had below average meals on one of your flights. Luckily, we took some food with us as a precaution, thank goodness we did.",January 2023,1,1,5,5,3,1,5,1
1,Flight Auckland to Bali,"We had a /Qantas credit about to expire so chose to go to Bali for 9 days. Our flight took us via Melbourne flying both legs on a 737.
Check in at Auckland was flawless and we boarded on time.
Qantas' choice to use a narrow body aircraft for a 4 hour flight to me seemed somewhat concerning. And it was justified, the seats are very close together with knees touching the seat in front.
The flight had about 12 empty seats allowing a lucky few to stretch out.
A bagged meal was passed out not long after seat belt signs went out. It was the same bag for all passengers and included a small bap with some relish and processed cheese wrapped in foil (my partner just got the relish). There was also a blister pack of small crackers with a chutney dip. a bloated packet of banana bread and bag of mini white chocolate cookies. The cookies were very sweet but I'm a sucker for white chocolate so I ate these. I've always been quite tolerant of airline food, it can't be easy to serve meals in flight conditions, but this was just disappointing. I tried everything to see if it tasted better than it looked...but it didn't. It all went back into the bag practically untouched.
The drinks trolley followed with tea, coffee, juice and water. If you fancied a wine or beer you were out of luck.
It was time to sit back, relax and watch something on the small screen. This must be an old aircraft as the screens appeared very dated. To make a selection required a bit of pressure as the guy behind me kept demonstrating with my headrest continually jolting forward. The selection was limited and it was difficult to find something to watch or listen to.
I decided to try and get as comfortable as possible on a hard seat with the recline function removed. Comfort was not an option.
The staff were very friendly and professional but it was a hard and long 4 hours.
We were crossing our fingers that the next leg would be an improvement.

It was but not by much.
The aircraft was practically identical. Cramped, hard seats, poor entertainment system, two toilets for around 160 passengers, no room to get up and stretch the legs....
The meal I selected was a beef rendang curry served in a small cardboard box followed by an ice block. They did serve alcohol on this flight.
Once again the staff were great, but 6 hours in those conditions was painful and I'm dreading the rapidly approaching day when we have to do the trip in reverse.
Generally I quite enjoy flying but I will never repeat this journey. Ever!
The bright note to finish...we arrived in Bali on time.",February 2023,1,1,1,4,1,3,4,1
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"I booked with Fiji airlines who partnered with Quantas for the return portion of the trip.
Due to covid I was not allowed to enter Australia. To make a long story short, when I went to redeem that portion of the ticket I got the run around so bad to the point that they lied. I finally got through and demanded a refund they emailed me the refund information . I called and was told the refund would take a few hours which didn't make since so I called again and was told 3 to 5 business days then I was told 6 to 8 weeks. That was Dec 20th 2022 it is now Feb 12th and still no refund.....at this point they can take the 1250.00 USD and buy some class this airlines lacks.
And from what I've learned it's company wide.....",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Like the QANTAS of old,"I have been very critical of QANTAS of late but to be honest this flight was like the old days, the service was exceptional with crew being super attentive, polite and most of all friendly, I was absolutely surprised to see the return of the breakfast card...nice touch QANTAS.",January 2023,5,5,3,5,4,4,4,5
1,NEVER EVER AGAIN!!,"Even if it meant never flying again I will not use Qantas.Their service is absolutely shocking.I travel with a walking stick and rollator walker which usuallyy means by-passing check-in lines which is a grea help as I cannot stand for very long,so got to Sydney to check in,made to stand in a long queue,the girl at check in had no idea about anything,she wanted to charge excess baggae for my walker which was wron as mobility items are carried free.I advised when making booking that I would need wheelchair to the departure gate ,I waited 1 hour for that.

Return flight despite them seeing me with my walker I was asked if I could walk up stairs to aircraft....NO.!
So arrive hame and collected bagggae then was sent all over the terminal to locate my walker only to find that the basket from the front was missing and when I asked about it the only response was""I dunno,it's not here"".Ok so put the walker up to leave terminal and it collapsed,it was broken and the front wheels kept collapsing.!
So off to baggage claims area where the lady behind counter said""hang on a minute"" which became 5,then took about 25 minutes to print 2 pages of instructions how to claim damages but only if it was a recent purchase and I had receipts.
Alan Joyce surew ewarns his money easy.Never Again.
Really wish I could given no stars.",February 2023,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,1
1,I would prefer to drown in urine than fly Qantas,If you ever want to become an expert in taking a good thing and f*cking it until it can no longer function. Ask Alan Joyce.

1,Should be a 0 star,"Messed up flights, cancelled, rescheduled for a day later, delayed etc. Didn't need a transit visa, but due to their delay a transit visa for being in transit in Sydney more than 8 hours was required, was rerouted via Brisbane via Dubai to JHB from Christchurch. Arrived 24hours later. The same happened 2 weeks earlier.
Will not recommend Qantas ever and surely when flights are delayed a waiver should be applied for transit visa.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Ms,"Qantas messed up my flight now several times. I needed to change my flight as I was issued the incorrect ticket (I booked a return ticket Brisbane to Delhi, leaving February returning May, and was issued a ticket from Brisbane to Colombo, Delhi to Brisbane instead).. The call centre staff over the phone had trouble understanding this and fixing it, even assuming I had made the mistake myself which is impossible for a return ticket, and also, I never looked at tickets to Colombo at all, it was just a stop over. And I spent hours on the phone sorting it out. The first person said she would reissue the ticket and nothing was done for days. I called back and there was no record of my previous request. Eventually I was given another ticket but it had an overnight stopover in Melbourne due to the ticket I had actually booked being no longer available. I requested to change again as I wasn't told this over the phone but was asked to pay. I change the flight for another day (after 2 1 hour phone calls) and was told it had been changed, was all booked. I didn't check immediately and just assumed it was fine but have found that the ticket has not been fixed, only half the ticket has been booked on the correct date and the previous ticket is still booked in! I have spent genuinely atleast 4 hours on the phone to Qantas and they are very slow to resolve problems. Have never had trouble like this with any airline and expected better from Qantas",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"It's been a few years since we flew Business on a trip and previous flights had been a pleasant experience. Not so this Qantas one!
The first shock was the Qantas Lounge at Auckland. Decorated in drab, bowling club decor and uncomfortable chairs close together. There were children running around having a great time trying food. As for the food - it was a minimal effort. A soup, butter chicken and rice, salad/cold cuts, cheese and fruit and a couple of slices.
Then the flight, 737 800.
We compared Business Class with First Class on NSW's XPT train and the train came off best.
The train had more space and leg room. The food was about equal. Reheated individual serve meals (choice of two, train of five) of similar quality. Qantas served a dessert of a boxed long-life cupcake whereas the train had good quality icecream and similar cakes.
As for service we were offered a drink upon seating and a drink with the meal. When the meal was finished and the clean up, it was time for the attendants to have good gossip with off duty airline staff flying in business for the remainder of the flight.
They reappeared for landing.
Did we think the experience was worth the extra fare for Business Class?
Good heavens - no, no, no!!
Qantas has sunk to the absolute pits.
There is no effort exerted by anyone. They are just putting in the hours for the pay and no one, let alone management, knows or cares.
Save your money and fly Economy!",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Why go business class,"As this trip to Sydney was most probably out last treat, we decided to fly business in spite of the cost. What a mistake! The plane was older them me, my seat would not recline, I had great difficulty getting the foot rest down, no TV and my husband had to get out of his seat for me to get past to go to the toilet. There was a drop down TV which, as I am small, I could not see. We were disgusted that there was such an old aircraft on one of the longest flights in Australia.The only saving grace was the delightful gentleman who looked after us. He is the best I have ever had on a flight, in fact, the complete cabin crew were great. We have decided to get rid of our frequent flyer points as we shall never fly with them again.",December 2022,3,1,1,5,2,3,5,3
1,Terrible,"Terrible service
I’m travelling solo with 2 kids (2 and 4years old)
I have bought our tickets just for the fact that I was able to carry 2 extra baby items per kid (car seat and pram). On the booking reservation up until the payment it is specifically written I am allowed but now that I’ve paid and checked my tickets it doesn’t mention those items anymore.
EVERY single time I called to try to find out , I am told different things.
It’s very concerning as when I’m landing I have a car with no car seat !!!!!

No one seems to want to help or care

My sister and her baby were supposed to fly with them last month and when she randomly called to check on her baggage allowance they casually told her that they had cancelled their tickets (with no email or text to let her know) 5days before the flight ..!!!",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Worst FF programme,"Is it just my imagination or has Qantas deliberately designed its FF flight booking page to be obstructive, frustrating and a down right time waster? Having just spent over 5 hours trying to navigate and search for flights I have come away empty handed again. I then logged into my Singapore Airlines FF account and booked the flights I was after within 15 minutes. No more long haul or international flying with Qantas for myself and family ever again. There is no point showing loyalty to an airline that's has such little respect for its passengers.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Customer service not educated about seatings,"I call the 131313 number twice and the assistants confirm in both cases that I will be getting a bassinet for the seat 45E and F.
Then, a FRIEND of mine informed me about the correct info related to bassinet availability, that it is not available for 45E 45F, but only available for rows D and G.
I called and confirmed the third time, otherwise I would have been in deep trouble on the departure date.

Serious concern for the qanatas service team as I would have been furious if that were to happen on the day of departure when I confirmed it 2 times with staff.

I hope the headquarters know that customer service team members are not informed about these details, and my friend who told me about this had to call 4 times to fix the same problem.",February 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Pram Damaged and now what?,"Ok, I try to calm down while I will.write this review. Probably not very likely. So we flew and had our pram worth 1000-1500 Euros checked into to oversize baggage. We use this pram regularly for my 15 month year old daughter and would have loved to use it couple more years really.
Arrived in Melbourne airport. got the pram damaged back ,bent connection to wheel.aka pram is not usable at all.
Women at the tullamarine airport documented all it and said Quantas have someone in frankston he could fix it. He said he can't cause he doesn t have the brand of my pram. Then every single week I made a customer call to Quantas about any information on what to do because I like a refund or solution really.
1. They could not find the case number the woman gave me from the airport. Then a new one was created. Saying someone will contact me back.never happend.
2. Week after I called back ..took ages to find out my new case number ..and then they realized this new case number was not assigned to an agent which is why nobody responded for a week . But now they will contact me within 24-48 hours they said with this new case number.
3. Nothing happend for a week.called back .after another 30 min on the phone it was found out that the wrong department was it referred to. And now they contacted customer service which is only reachable via chat from the department I called (??) Wtf..
Then they said they defo call me back but I will have to provide evidence or proof.
4. Nothing happend for a week again.
Getting an email today for my case saying they are not liable for any damages on baggage .
Thanks for nothing Quantas
The most appaling customer service ever.
What happens to my damaged pram??
Unbelievable in times like these.
The worst is ,you can't contact anyone.everybody has excised but no solutions.
Absolutely gutted.

I have contacted their Customer Care team innumerable times and have been told multiple times that either a) I will be reimbursed within 5-10 working days, or b) someone from the team will call me back to tell me the status of my refund, or c) it will be escalated immediately. NONE of this has happened. I have wasted so much of my time and energy trying to get what is owed me by a clearly untrustworthy company. Furthermore, there seems to be no way to contact their head office directly. You always end up talking to someone at a call center outside of Australia.

1,Not a Professional Look,"We were on a trip to New Zealand and had to urgently re-book flights back to Perth as a family member was seriously ill.

The lady I spoke to originally was incompetent. She messed up our email addresses so that we never received a confirmation of the flights or an e-ticket. She did not record our Frequent Flyer numbers which would have helped a lot and also got my wife’s name completely wrong. The lady was obviously not in Australia and there was a lot of noise in the background including both children and chickens!

1,Disgusting Customer Service,"Disgusting customer service! I had to cancel return flights to Sydney in 2020 due to Covid lockdown. I requested a refund as when we booked new flights a year later we were told that had to pay cash for the new flights and to seek a refund for the cancelled flights. I have been ringing and emailing Qantas for 8 months with no refund in sight. They keep asking for the same information each time I call. I have been told many times that the refund has been authorised and will be paid within 6-8weeks. What sort of banking system do they use, Pony Express? Someone please show them how to use EFT. I have also asked for my non payment complaint to be escalated several times. I have been contacted by Qantas Customer Service several times and not only told me my refund will be investigated but blatantly lied to in emails advising that the refund has already been paid. After checking every bank account confirming that this was not the case. In my latest contact with QCS today I was asked for the account number from which the tickets were paid to allow them to refund the money. This information has provided to them in writing several times going back several months and every time I am told I will have to wait 6-8 weeks from the date of my enquiry for the refund to be paid. I have totally lost my patience having been waiting for my refunds for 8 months and any respect I have had for Qantas and I am now lodging a formal complaint with ACCC. This whole saga has taken up many hours of my time, often being kept on hold for more than an hour. My next course of action will be to write directly to Alan Joyce. I have given Qantas one star because that is the minimum but they don't deserve it.",July 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas Just Don’t Care,"The air hostess were rude, rolling their eyes when i asked about nuts in the food due to anaphylaxis to tee nuts.

We arrived an hour late to Sydney airport. We waited at the baggage carousel for 2 hours with no updates only to be told that Qantas had lost everyone’s from our flight luggage and to lodge a lost baggage claim.

I called Qantas multiple time thinking it was an Australian Airline but everyone i spoke to was overseas. I was told they had located my bags but i had to wait for the phone call from the team at Sydney Airport.

I called back 2 days later to be told no sorry your bags have not yet been located.

I am unable to talk to anyone no one can explain why a whole planes luggage has gone missing !

We have all of our clothes in the bags and cannot afford to buy new clothes, Qantas simple don’t care as long as Money is their pocket!

A big shout out to Gemma Suales, Isabelle Dick, Kristine Wasnett, Sally Johnston, Richard Boyne.

1,Lost $1814 for entering the wrong name on Red-E ticket,"I am a faithful Qantas Silver Member who booked some very expensive Christmas Domestic Red-E tickets from Syd-Adl ($1814) and failed to realise I had booked both tickets in my name. I immediately called customer service to change the other name to my partner's but as it was a Red-E ticket it wasn't possible. The Customer Service agent said it was possible to get a refund or at least a flight credit on cancellation so we went ahead with that and borrowed extra money to buy two more tickets at a similar price (now $3600 down on my bank balance). I was refunded the taxes only ($56 each) and after more than 9 weeks of waiting I have been told ""Its in the T's and C's of the special fare"" that you cant change anything so there will be no refund. This is a situation of passing the buck by Customer Service to not tell us they wont refund anything (we could have at least kept one ticket in my name) and of scandalously unfair conditions for wanting to simply change the name on the booking. All tickets were cancelled and repurchased on the same day - Qantas couldn't care less. In an email they said they could send a letter of the dispute for my travel insurance but on reply they had already closed the case number and I could get no further response. Appalling corporate behaviour, oblivious to the actual situation of wanting to change the name under the ""Same day, no mistake "" policy they have. Beware - they say you can change your ticket up to 24 hours - BUT if its a Red-E deal they don't mention you forfeit ANY kind of refund or credit.",December 2022,4,4,4,3,4,4,5,5
5,Unbelievably compassionate and helpful customer service,"At the last minute, about to board our flight from LAX to Australia, my teenage daughter got sick. Qantas put us up (two rooms) in a hotel near the airport, even though we had flown to LA on a separate itinerary. They changed our tickets, and they changed our daughter's ticket three times until she was finally well enough to join us in Oz. As if that weren't enough, we had booked the least expensive economy tix, and they flew my teenager business class. Every time I called to make yet one more change they were nothing but empathetic and helpful, calling in the manager to make necessary alterations, all without a single extra charge. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",July 2022,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,4
1,Nothing but an absolute nightmare!,"I was due to travel from Brisbane to Auckland in December. I was unable to get on the flight due to becoming unwell with mental health issues. I had bought a refundable ticket - therefore I am eligible for a refund… however Qantas for 8 weeks now are causing me nothing but stress and upset. The booking was made through a travel agent to begin with but was altered directly through Qantas - and paid to qantas direct - however they are saying I have to go through the travel agency to get my refund … but Lastminute.com are sending me back to qanatas saying they can’t be any help now the departure date has been but also due to the fact qantas we’re the ones who changed my flight / took my money. The both agree i’m available for a reason but both are refusing to help me sort it and keep saying they can’t do anything it’s down to the other person. I even spoke to someone in Brisbane at the desk who made a note on my account saying please make the refund. This has gone on for 8 weeks, about 15 phone calls to both companies but still not getting any further. Qantas promised to ring me back on Saturday with the manager but did they? of course not. Nothing but disgraceful. So I continue to fight the battle to try and get my refund.

I am a 23 year old girl suffering from mental health issues, was unable to fly due to medical reasons and now they are causing me nothing but more stress and anxiety. Would never use Qantas again.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The return flight also left right on scheduled time and arrived 15 minutes early. Our bags were waiting for us.

1,Run and fly away from Qantas,"Flight cancelled. No prior info. Got up at 4am to catch the flight. Upon check in I was asked to wait aside after Auckland airport was flooded. I could not go to Blenheim my final destination. All my bookings (accommodation, flights, car rental, tours, wine tasting…)were lost and all Qantas employees were just careless repeating that the airport was shut after the flooding and that it was not their fault….like if it was my fault! I paid to be taken to Blenheim and got taken to Christchurch and it seems that I should be satisfied with that even if I had to-rebook and spend accomodation there.
I was offered to go to Christchurch instead of Blenheim (4 hours drive from Blenheim) had to wait 4 hours at Sydney airport and I was not even offered to access Qantas lounge waiting for the connection!
And no need to say that this trip was one life time journey since I am coming from Europe spending 2 months travelling between Melbourne, Sydney, Tasmania, New Zealand and the Gold Coast.
A true unacceptable way of dealing with customers. Fly away from Qantas they are not driven by guest satisfaction and inly trained to say that they understand although no action shows that they really do!

1,Quantas lounge,I am travelling from Perth to Johannesburg via Sydney. I have business class tickets. I got told at the quantas lounge at Perth that I will not be permitted to enter even though I have a business class ticket because I have flip flops on. Apparently I need closed shoes. Why was I not informed of this policy when making my booking? I've travelled extensively and have never experienced such a policy before. When travelling long distances or many legs on a trip being comfortable is a top priority and flip flops trump closed shoes any day. I will avoid Quantas in future as my ticket paid for that lounge visit that I was denied.,January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,No Way To Plan With Qantas,"No Way To Plan With Qantas

I am very saddened by the quality of Qantas Airlines. I had my flight from Auckland (AKL) to Cochin(COK) via Sydney.
Lost my bags between Sydney and Banglore and had 7 hours delay for the return flight from Melbourne.

In-flight travel was clunky and rattling with an antique in-flight entertainment system that is barely functioning.
The aircraft was old and once again we are paying a premium price for a budget service. The QANTAS brand is no longer appealing.
Meals on Qantas is absolutely embarrassing, more likely to die from the plane food than an aviation crash.

1,Horrible service + flight cancelled + flight delayed,"Issue #1: I booked a direct return flight from Perth to Jakarta (4 hours flight). The flight was cancelled and changed into another flight with transit via Singapore.

So a simple 4 hour flight turned into a much longer flight while travelling with 1 infant and 1 kid. Our return flight now took 18 hours! No compensation was offered whatsoever!

Issue #2: The flight that departed from Perth to Singapore was delayed by 1-2 hours. This caused a very short amount of transit time in Singapore. Because of which our luggages were not able to be carried through to Jakarta, so we landed in Jakarta without luggage.

Issue #3: On the return ticket, the flight was delayed by 2 hours. Now our flight landed in Perth at 2:30AM instead of 12:30AM. Again this is very frustrating, especially when travelling with 2 small kids. Again no compensation was offered whatsoever.

I can't believe so many things went so wrong in 1 booking?!

5,QANTAS Flights a delight compared with their global peers....,"I know it is a national pastime to have a go at QANTAS at the moment but our trip to Japan and Hawaii, flying JAL, Hawaiian Airlines and QANTAS put it into perspective. Yes, our QF was 40 minutes late leaving Honolulu because of a broken toilet, and some of the charging facilities in our seats didn't work. But - they actually communicated what was happening, they made up the time, they communicated to people with potentially impacted connections and there were on ground service staff to deal with any outstanding questions. None of those were in place for Hawaiian Airlines. And atleast there were charging facilities in the seats. Not so JAL. Nor did JAL have the headrests that bend around your head to support you while sleeping. Only QANTAS offered a pillow and blanket to everyone onboard, regardless of what you had paid for your seat. QANTAS offered excellent food choices - the others either offered nothing or no choice at all - just slapped the hamburger patty on top of the reheated frozen three veg on the tray in front of you. QANTAS offered plant forward and two meat options. They provided dessert for every meal. Chocolate treats. Fresh salads. Warm garlic bread. Gin and tonics for each meal service. Craft beers, again regardless of your class of flight. Shortest wait for some time for baggage. Engaging and friendly staff.

This is probably a little unfair for JAL as we flew shorter trips and the point isn't to criticise them. The point is that QANTAS stood tall. They weren't perfect. But neither is anyone else out there. They got all the basics right and had a few unexpected nice surprises to add.",January 2023,4,5,5,5,3,4,5,5

Five minutes from the airport we got text saying delayed 2 hrs. We had arrived three hours early as told, so now a wait of 5 hours. But thinking we at least have the business class lounge all should be good. The lounge was packed with little options for seating. We ended up at the far left side of the lounge. The only food station (one only for all the passengers) was on the far right side of the lounge. Food available was three hot dishes (rice, butter chicken and soup). All luke warm. Cold offerings was lettuce leaves, cold slaw, quinoa and rice salads, all pretty bland and boring. Bread rolls with butter. No butter after two hours. Two cakes for sweets (Sara Lea carrot cake and can't start to describe the other but stale and hard). One coffee station. See attached photo's. Our plane was then delayed a further two times with boarding from 5.10pm actually being 10.20pm. The food offerings did not change during that 5.5hour wait.

Super upset with Qantas. If ur airline commit the freeze facility please take in writing as staff is super rude and don’t care of neither 1000s dollars injection nor well beings of person. No sympathy for special needs customers.

Also, they skipped my breakfast and haven’t severed and when I told they told me that we don’t have anything for vegetarian whereas I saw that Ido was served to other customers as well as haven’t provided proper food for dinner, snacks and lunch is just boiled veggies with no spices and salt. Extremely poor Service of staff. Staff asked me to eat chicken whereas I already told that I requested strict vegetarian meals (jain).

Third thing is miscommunication, I booked the flight and then they changed it so I called customer service that 50 mins will not be enough to change the flight from international to domestic flight whereas they clearly told that it’s enough as I don’t have to take luggage and immigration clear which was denied at checkin so required to change the flight in last minute which was big hassle.

Was told I'd be on the 1pm flight the following day. Decided to ring to make sure and ask for an email detailing the new flight only to find out that I wasn't actually book on any new flight. Took 40mins to sort out a new ticket.

1,Worst service I had in 15 years of travel,"Myself and a family of two young kids stuck in Singapore airport for two nights ... I have booked the direct flight through Qantas from Brisbane to Bangalore which has Malaysian Airlines connection between Singapore and Bangalore ..

It's all started here .... Our jouney from Sydney - Singapore has delayed by an hour and half.... Reached Singapore at 7.30pm on 1st of December 2022. Our connection flight from Singapore to Malaysia was at 7.30pm and the ground staff has advised it's been cancelled ... Around 10 families were gathered and ground staff were trying to solve the issue (Please note when I checked the email later I observed Malaysian airlines which is the cancelled connection as per quantas sent me an email about their delayed start at 8.30pm but I have not received any email regarding their cancellation of flight🙄.. So I doubt it's cancelled.)

[07/12/2022, 11:27 am] Rijesh KV: Ground staff spoke to us arranged flight for us .. Wrote in a paper next day's flight details.. I have asked them for tickets and booking .. They said its all booked and Sent us to hotel.. This was our first experience and we believed them.. and there was other people as well..
[07/12/2022, 11:34 am] Rijesh KV: The first day first half was great.. The accommodation was good, food was good.. We left after lunch to airport for the 22:55 flight. First thing we did was to call the customer care and confirming the flight details are right... After calling about an hour they have been connected and advised us the flights are good to go tonight.. I asked them about the tickets and there is no update in the Qantas app... They did not have any answer... Luckily I saw the Qatar airways counter check in and checked with them our flights at 22:55 (Please note our connection they have arranged at 22:55 was from Singapore to Doha and Doha to trivandum India through Qatar airways)... That's where I got the first shock... The flight already departed at 10:55 and the ground staff did an error informing it as 22:55.. I could not believe how the customer confirmed our flight an hour ago when I checked them...
[07/12/2022, 11:41 am] Rijesh KV: Hereafter I have got a clear picture of how bad the customer service and Qantas system for customer support... The major cause of this issue is they don't have a system in place when flights cancelled .. As a customer I did not get a ticket or even the app was not updated , so that I could not check for their mistakes... (Another weird thing happened is someone else in my hotel who became a good friend of mine later had a Singapore Bangkok flight booked.. That popped up in my app, theirs got automatically cancelled ... Later I understood actually ours should be cancelled , not theirs... Pathetic system.. Those guys even got our luggage when they requested luggage , luckily they knew us and let us knew)

The situation became bad and I was worried as the young kids of 4 & 9 are with me .. The customer care did not worry about the accommodation .. I kept on calling the customer service .. An hour to connect and tell the whole story.. After couple of hours they booked a flight (they said) and advised us they will send tickets.. I don't have to call them.. I lost my belief on them , called once more and confirmed booking ... They said they will send an email confirmation after tickets issued.. Asked about my accommodation, they advised they will pay 200 dollars for overnight stay... Singapore is a costly city, a 200 dollar accommodation will never be good also its a last time booking ... Anyway we did not have any choice... went there .. had our half sleep.. Early morning 4am checked for emails .. No tickets.. Called the customer care again... One hour of call to repeat the story.. It took another couple of hours to get the tickets sent to us...

Finally we went to airport after two nights staying in Singapore.. We were all exhausted.. Got srinlankan Airlines to Colombo then from there to Bangalore (India)... The root cause of the problem is their manual handling of these issues, not proper updating of the system... Hope no one will have these issues in future... After all these issues, our return flight from Bangalore has got auto cancelled and had to book again..",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,beware 24 hour cancellation promise if using Qantas pass you will lose the value,Qantas make a big splash on their booking page regarding a 24 hour cancellation promise. This works if you're paying with cash or points but beware they will rob you of your Qantas pass value with this process. This is a major gap in your process Qantas - the customer service staff have no process for this either and could not explain whether I'd ever see my funds again.,January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

5,Business Class Sydney to Perth,"Flew from Sydney to Perth Business class seat 4A and i must say I travel a lot of miles on lots of airlines and this would have been the best Domestic Business fkight I have ever been on. The cabin and lavatory were clean, the staff were engaging and friendly, the food was excellent and great choices and the drink service and choice was also great. It made a 5 hour flight very enjoyable and a pleasure to fly with a great airline.",January 2023,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
1,Most horrible business class travel experience,"There should be a zero for this airlines. They don’t even deserve 1.
Travelling with 13 people in business class and being served with a set menu in a restaurant at the airport , as qantas has no lounge. Worst airlines with no one to listen. I lost my baggage from my flight from melbourne to delhi to start off with and then this experience at the airport when flying back, with passengers on wheelchair, children and an infant. Please save your hard earned money , so you don’t feel wasted. To add to your dilemma and disappointment there is limit on food and drinks. And no tea and coffee",January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Qantas Fail,Arrived at airport and was told business class was full and we must fly economy. Qantas havent followed up and three months later we are still trying to get a refund. If something goes wrong with them there is no means for recourse. Steer clear!,October 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Disgraceful Customer Service,"Flight was delayed overnight and we were told to get hotels. We were both told and given a letter saying we would be reimbursed for expenses. A month later, 20 emails, phone calls - no response and $1000 out of pocket. Incredibly disappointed in Qantas",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Compensation. 7 hour late arrival,"We paid a premium price to fly Business Class from London Heathrow to Melbourne with a short stop over in Perth before boarding the same plane to complete our journey to Melbourne.
On arrival in Perth we were “bumped” off our plane .
Our plane was hijacked for a return flight to London .
We waited for over 6 hours for a plane from Melbourne to complete our flight.
We eventually arrived in Melbourne 7 hours late .
We have been flying to Melbourne for 15 years what was going to be our shortest flight was the longest we have ever experienced.
We have been trying to claim our legally entitled compensation from Qantas since September 14th 2022 under EU / GB legislation ,
They have been totally obstructive and impossible to deal with and no apology for our 7 hour delay .
We have now taken the matter up with the CAA .

Do Qantas have a Customer Care Service Department ??
If I ran my business like Qantas and treated my customers in a similar manner I would go out of business !!!
How long will Qantas last !!!!",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,NO respect for Passengers,"Qantas cancelled my connecting flight from Vancouver to Sydney Australia while I was at the boarding gate at Heathrow (21st Dec), giving me no alternative but to get on their partner airlines (Air Canada) flight without knowing what would happen when I arrived at Vancouver.
At the Qantas desk, I and other passengers were told by the Qantas staff that we were rebooked on a flight on the 23rd Dec. then they handed us a ‘disclaimer’ sheet saying that as it’s a weather related cancellation, they would NOT provide accommodation/food or transport. It was minus -9 and we were told ‘claim off your insurance’
We were able to find out online that there was an Air Canada (PARTNER AIRLINE) flight leaving later that night to Brisbane, so we asked if we could be put on that.
The Qantas supervisor was adamant that the airport was shut down and NO flights were leaving (incoming only) and had been like that for the previous few days! - again, if so, then why were we allowed to depart Heathrow & not placed on a different route to Sydney??
After several hours of strong discussion with the Qantas staff about the fact that there WAS a flight leaving Vancouver for Brisbane and requesting (and failing) that a more senior Qantas representative be present.
I asked for the supervisors name (Jane) and insisted that she get her superior on the phone. She said he wasn’t picking up as he was on vacation!!
I asked her for his name and she said he was called Bill as I wanted the person (Bill) reports to, to come speak to us stranded passengers.
Eventually after SEVERAL hours and insistence that Jane keep trying to go up the Qantas chain of command until we speak to someone capable of resolving this issue (still no word from Bill) - miraculously, there was an Air Canada flight leaving that night for Brisbane and we all found seats on it!!
Turns out, that there were so many spare seats that people were lying across three seats able to sleep!
So WHY did Qantas put us passengers through this??
If I’d meekly accepted their disclaimer sheet I’d have been stranded at Vancouver and missed my family reunion for Xmas in Sydney.
Worst customer service experience EVER.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Disgusting Meal,"We have not Flown with Qantas for more than 25 years and were looking forward to the Flight . We were returning to Sydney after our Journey to Perth on the Indian Pacific . We had a few Dramas with the Booking with our first Booking being Cancelled by Qantas and then being Booked on a replacement Flight which was not convenient for us as it meant we had to be at the Airport around 6am . We chose a mor appropriate Flight and rang Qantas to secure this Flight . That was changed without too much fuss and then they tried to charge us Extra Money for changing the Flight . I reminded the Lady that it was Qantas that Cancelled the original Flight . She put us on Hold for about 30 seconds before coming back and informing us that the Fee would be Waived . We arrived about 2 and a half hours prior to our flight . Check in was by way of Machines . I could not get the thing to work so I contacted a nice gentleman in a Qantas Uniform and he took us to his Computer Terminal and checked us in there , we were then shown to the Bag Drop area to drop of our cases . We were now ready to go through security .
Security completed we went to find our Gate No 12 . As we waited and the time for our Departure was getting nearer , the Plane had not yet arrived at our Gate .
Approximately 10 minutes before our schedule departure time the plane arrived . An Airbus A330 / 200 . We have flown on one to Bali with Garuda . They have a 2 - 4 -2 Configuration in Economy . Our Seats were 55 J & K , Window & Aisle .
By the time we had Boarded and the Doors Closed we were 30 minutes behind Schedule . Taxying only took a couple of Minutes and we were soon on our way to Sydney . The Captain came on the speaker to announce that we had a good Tail Wind and the we should arrive in Sydney ahead of Schedule . Good Luck rather than Good Management .
Cabin Crew came around with Meal service , a choice of Chicken Salad or Slow Cooked Beef Ravioli . We both chose the Beef Ravioli . The Meal was served in a Cardboard Box with Wooden Knife & Fork which were absolutely useless . The Knife could not cut Pasta and the Fork just bent with the slightest pressure .The Ravioli was supposed to have a Tomato Sauce. This was non existent ., with not even a Trace of it . The Pasta was so Dry it was devoid of all Moisture and was the consistency of Cardboard . The filling could have been anything as it had NO flavor at all .I was hungry and tried to eat it however I gave up after 2 pieces . It was disgusting . The Cabin crew came around with drinks and we both had a Beer . After finishing our Beers we were asked if we would like another , which we did . The Cabin Crew were good , both Friendly and attentive . Soon we were descending into Sydney and were at the Gate by the Scheduled arrival time . There was a delay of about 20 minutes before our Bags were on the conveyor . The Flight was OK , The Cabin Crew were great . The Initial Booking was ok but Qantas managed to cause an upheaval which the did fix . I hate Self Check in . The Beer was Good The Food was Disgusting and Qantas need to do much Better than serving Food like this .",December 2022,3,4,1,5,3,3,1,1
1,"terrible, do not fly with quantas","there were many of us on our flight who's baggage was not put on our plane and after the plane with the baggage finally landed, it took over 6 hours for it to actually arrive to my hotel (which was 20mins from airport). terrible service, was not accomodating and no baggage department to call to chase up the issue.",January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Sad how Qantas is dropping quality,"As my national carrier I am very saddened by how the quality of Qantas has dropped over the last few years. We visited UK for Xmas and booked Qantas, going over we were put on Emirates flights. The first issue was not being allowed in Emirates club despite being a Qantas club member. If you book an airline and they bump you to someone else you should be able to have the same paid for privileges! As it turned out the Emirates flight was great. lovely staff, comfy plane , very good food and snacks. Coming back we came Qantas on the long haul from London to Perth. What a difference to the Emirates experience! Uncomfortable cramped plane, food was barely edible, no little niceties and generally just felt like a budget airline experience. To top it all off a week later we are still waiting for one of our cases to arrive in Perth! Qantas used to be a very good airline but the last 5 years it has slowly gone down and down in its standards. Very sad.",December 2022,2,2,3,2,1,3,3,1
1,"Qantas = Quarrelsome, Awful, Nasty, Terrible, Appalling, Shameless","Awful Qantas just keeps on cancelling flights and to hell with its customers. When will the law give us customers better rights against that sort of disgusting conduct.
My partner's flight to NZ was cancelled with no notice, at the airport. They said there would be a 4 hour delay. All of the passengers just sat around, missing whatever they had planned. Then after 6 hours qantas said, no, the next QF flight would be the next day. Only some people managed to get on an Air New Zealand flight on the same day, but much later..
Then they just cancelled a flight we had to Perth. This time with 36 hours notice, and put on a much later flight rerouted around the country. That that messed up entirely the car hire and other arrangements we had put in place.
Will never book to fly on Quarrelsome, Awful, Nasty, Terrible, Appalling, Shameless again.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Missed the connecting flight,"Lounge still needs attention, food selection in Qantas lounge is way below my experiences with others. The inflight experience was comfortable but definitely not worth the prices they are charging for their tickets. I think their flight attendants need to be refreshed, they look tired and worn out. In flight meals were good. Unfortunately due to late departure i missed my connecting flight and had to wait hours at Sydney for the next one.",October 2022,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,4

Disappointing.",January 2023,3,3,3,3,2,4,5,3
1,"Airport Staff - Rude, arrogant and racists!","At the start of your journey, you get greeted with the passive aggressive ladies at the check-in counter. Rude, arrogant and have massive chips on their shoulders. They need to learn some manners and basic customer service.

I travelled 3-4 times a year on international flights with Qantas - only because of all the ff points through our business. Almost every time (unless I fly business class) the middle aged ladies are discriminating against all passengers of Asian heritages. If you take a look at reviews or public forums you will see how many times it’s been stated by past passengers.

It’s always the same middle aged Caucasian Australian female flight attendants who are exactly the same. They get extremely frustrated if you speak or ask them for something. They might as well had asked me to get my own water and food. They always make me feel like I’m wasting their time and not worthy of their presence. Their attitude is so bad that sometimes I forget it’s 2023 and racism still exists.

They are by far the worst airline in the world!",January 2023,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,first and last time flying qantas,"- We flew on airbus a380 in 27th december. Qantas lost both our baggage for a week. I had ordered a special requirement meal and I was told at the plane that they forgot it to london. Cabin crew seemed not friendly and didn't ask us what we want to drink during dinner. In-flight entertainment was ok, but the touch screen was hard to use. It was really cold during the flight.

they can’t find the bags!!! they won’t talk to us!!!!! all we get is a crappy phone message saying it’s not there fault, it’s all over the world issues…..

1,Bought Extra Leg Room Seat (but not given the seat I paid for NOR refunded for it),"I underwent major knee surgery in Brisbane and specifically purchased a window seat with extra leg room for my return flight to Canberra. (I was in a straight leg knee brace and on double crutches.)

The seat I bought was a window seat (15A) but during the actual flight, I was seated at 3C (aisle seat). I informed the steward that I bought a window seat with extra leg room (due to the fact that I had anticipated that I will be in a straight leg knee brace and possibly in pain). He told me that there is not much he can do to change my seat.

To my further horror, after I was seated, a man arrived for seat 3A (window seat). So, I had to get up off my seat to let him through. This ordeal happened three more times during the flight as he went to the bathroom. Each of these movements increased by pain and by the end of the flight, I was very nauseated from the pain. I finally threw up outside the Canberra airport.

Since then, I have lodged numerous online claims with Qantas to have the extra leg room seat fare refunded. I have also rang them up to follow up on my online lodgements. These calls were constantly (and conveniently) dropped and when the staff have promised to ring me back, they never did.

So today (06 Jan 2023), I rang up again and Qantas has conveniently lost all my details (as such a long time has lapsed since the flight). This delay is caused by Qantas itself, as I have continually followed up on it.

To sum up, I paid for an extra leg room seat, didn't get it and was not refunded for it. This is deceit and fraud and I don't know where else this practice is acceptable.",August 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
2,Staff Member Forgets to Put Baggage Label on Suitcase Bound for Fiji,"We are long term Qantas Frequent Flyers and have been loyal to this airline for over 2 decades. Recently our loyalty has been tested with a couple of poor travel experiences with Qantas in late 2022, culminating with this latest trip. This includes a very poor experience with Qantas Travel Money.

Our recent travel experience occurred on 19.12.22 when we went to check in at Melbourne Airport as a family of 4 for our trip to Fiji via Sydney. On this occasion the staff member checking our in luggage omitted to place a baggage label on 1 of our suitcases and sent the suitcase down to the baggage handlers without any baggage label. We we travelling via Sydney and needed our luggage transferred to Fiji Airlines and therefore baggage labels were important.

This event occurred whilst I was dealing with the administrative matters for the family, being 4 passports, vaccination certificates, travel Insurance, and so forth, whilst the suitcases were being weighed and then sent down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. My husband politely pointed out to the staff member that they had just sent 1 of our suitcases down to the baggage handlers without any Qantas baggage label. Our daughters aged 20 and 18 had also noticed that the suitcase had disappeared down the 'chute' with no label.

There was then dispute when the staff member denied that the suitcase had been sent without any baggage label.

We hope that as a family that we were very polite to this staff member, however my husband and daughters were vey clear about the situation. Eventually the staff member acknowledged that they had sent 1 of our daughter's suitcase down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. This suitcase had all of our daughter's clothes in it for her holiday and also our family's gifts to be exchanged on Christmas Day.

If any readers of this review have watched the 2022 media reports in relation to how baggage handles with Qantas have treated baggage at Melbourne Airpor recently, and also Charlie Pickering's parody of baggage handlers on ""The Yearly"" on Channel 2's IVEW, you will understand that we did not expect to see this suitcase again prior to the conclusion of our holiday.

Our travel to and from Fiji, via Sydney on Qantas was very pleasant. My husband and I travelled business and our daughters travelled economy. It was our first trip as a family holiday since March 2020, when the pandemic commenced.

However during whole flight from Melbourne to Nadi I worried that our daughter's suitcase would not appear in Nandi, and would be left at Melbourne Airport for weeks. This would have had a detrimental impact on our daughter's enjoyment of our her long awaited holiday.

The luggage did turn up in Nandi. However for our bookings in 2023 and 2024 we are now looking at other airlines. It is our cumulative experience with Qantas in the latter part of 2022, that sadly Qantas is not offering the service that we once so enjoyed from Qantas.

1,Qantas supervisor in Queenstown is absolutely rude!,"Qantas supervisor in Queenstown Airport is the worst customer service representative I have seen. As a oneworld sapphire member, I was entitled to extra baggage but was denied. The supervisor did not know what oneworld is, and when i asked her to confirm, she yelled at me, ""I have worked for 4+ years. Do not teach me how to do things. I just follow the system, even if the system is wrong, it is Qantas' issue not my issue"". She asked me to file a complaint. I asked her what her name was. She said she could not tell me. I said the purpose she was wearing a name tag was because she needed to be accountable for what she did. She then ignored me and said, ""there is a queue sir, can you just finish what you are saying"". This is absolutely rude and arrogant!",January 2023,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3

Yes, things go wrong, but it's how the issues are dealt with which demonstrates a company's integrity, and,unfortunately Qantas ""Customer care"" is non existent!!! So, a ⚠️ warning.

We had booked six months earlier and had paid a premium to travel direct. Qantas customer services were completely unhelpful. When asked if the flight had been cancelled, they said yes but according to flight radar it flew on schedule. Qantas deny any liability for compensation.

1,WORST FLIGHT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.,"I could not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. First of all, the turbulence was absolutely horrendous, I’ve been to Japan a number of times, and never have I experimented turbulence been that bad and lasted up to an hour. While you can’t blame the airline or the captain for it, but the way the staff handled their passengers was so disorganised. To note I have not been sick since I was a child, let alone motion sick; but this flight along with its disgusting food made me vomit. The flight attendants sure take their time to get to you even when the entire plane is quiet and seatbelt signs are off. After all the money you pay, you’d expect great service.

Not only is the actual flight experience bad, the moments leading up were worse. We booked a flight a flight in 2019, and because of Covid-19 it got cancelled. But not only was it cancelled, we did not receive a refund of the flight. We were told that the original flight money was kept as credit, and when we were given an opportunity to use the credit, prices for the exact flight doubled.

Seats were 14E/14F, for those not familiar, these are middle seats in the smaller front cabin of business class upstairs on the A380. Very comfortable seats, with nice bedding for sleeping (mattress pillow and blanket), and while the sash style seat belt was a little high for my wife I like the fact you can be slightly reclined for take off and landing with this seat belt.

Not a sign of any staff apart from one. Tried the auto machines but phone would not scan as requested. Went to speak to the one woman who immediately snapped ""Stand away from me"" She was apparently paranoid about covid but wasn't wearing a mask. I thought of suggesting that she get one. We were not the only people needing some polite assistance to get our tags as there was plenty of people trying to see her. The flight was fine with polite staff and as ex aircrew with thousands of flight hours I recognize and applaud those people for the job they do. However if this is what Qantas provide as passenger ground assistance we need to find another airline as this one has moved to the bottom of my list.",December 2022,4,3,3,4,2,4,1,3

We've had to buy new clothes, new toiletries and noone at Qantas cares one iota. We cannot get a doctor's appointment until the new year. Not even a courtesy call from Qantas or Menzies. Not 1 suitcase made the trip. Menzies Baggage Handlers (Qantas's handlers) don't respond. Qantas does not respond. CHOOSE ANOTHER AIRLINE!!",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Rabbit food, dated planes, poor in-flight entertainment","Pros: Direct to Bangalore, very convenient departure and arrival times both ways.

Cons: Dated planes with barely any leg room in the economy,

food was horrendous and both ways there was no choice other than a potato curry with rice.

Our flight was delayed by 90 mins in Bengaluru on the return leg after boarding, so the return leg became a 14 hr flight and we still got served 2 rabbit box takeaway potato curry.

Qantas for reasons only they know put me in the middle seat splitting a family of 4. I had 2 young kids and their mother on the left side and the father sitting on the right side of me. I asked the mother or father to move, so they could all sit together but both refused to sit with their own young children. Those 3 and 2 year old kids went absolutely nuts, high on pack of lollies. One of the kids emptied Orange juice all over me and their father sees it and says, ""they are just kids, that's OK"".

in-flight entertainment system is non-existent, so download Netflix movies.

To make things worse, Qantas lost my baggage on return leg. It was delivered the next day with heavy sticky tape as Sydney Customs cut open my brand new bag to look inside even though it had a TSA approved lock.

Paid $1700 for flights from Brisbane to Christchurch for my 4 yo granddaughter and I had requested child meal, was given a chicken in a Spice sauce and sloppy potatoes, I told them I had requested child meal and they said that is what the caterer supplied. Adults meal was even worse.

YOU SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY ASHAMED OF YOURSELF, UP YOUR GAME QANTAS, I WILL ONLY BE TRAVELLING WITH AIR NZ FROM NOW !!",December 2022,1,2,4,4,1,2,4,-1
2,Qantas economy,"Extremely disappointed with Qantas. Food was poorly presented and just passable in quality. Only one meal trolley,hence if you are at the back of the plane. Waiting was at least 2 hrs. Appalling entertainment system. Ear phones didn't work. No music no games, no camera on plane and movies low standard. Delay of 3 hrs departing with very poor communication. This flight cost me over $4000. What a rip off",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Baggage off loaded before departure.,"At approimately 3 hours before arrival at London on the non stop flight, we were told that our hold luggage had been off loaded before departure. However, we were promised it would be delivered to an address the next day. This did not happen and the 3 suitcases are still missing. We reported the issue to GBS and filled a report. We have tried to phone a variety of numbers but all the calls are unanswered.
Overall, I would not even recommend this airline to my worst enemy.",December 2022,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1
1,Poor Service,If i could give -0 to Qantas Flight. Not recommended at all. Poor customer service through their call centre. I booked and paid for a seat. At the time without letting me know they changed my mum's seat. did a complaint for seat refund. complaint was accepted still i did not received refund of seat booking. i called their call centre team. Sometime agent said thy had forwarded my complaint to the further department. When they dont have any answer for my queries than their team disconnect the call. Very rude behavious. Food is pathetic . My mom booked assistance from delhi airport. At the time they asked to 1500 INR for wheelchair assistance. Ridiculous at all.,September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Pathetic rabble,"Flight been delayed by nearly 6 hours and counting. No announcements, just text messages that force you to look up via manage booking. No apology of any sort. Highest levels of arrogance, a national disgrace.

I have been at Melbourne airport nearly 10 hours now, the only flights delayed are Qantas and Jetstar. No surprises here.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas baggage damages,"My baggage was damaged and customer support is pathetic. They are neither replacing for new baggage nor compensating for the damages. They answer our calls but put our calls on hold or they either decline our calls. Worst service. Service is very bad and incharge head in Bangalore,Rajesh doesn't bother to either to answer our questions nor to our calls. Would suggest not to travel in Qantas airlines as their customers service is really worst. Hope no customers should face like this ever.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Just rediculous. Stay away. Pay more to go elsewhere,"I am currently wearing qantas PJs for the second day as apparently they are to incompetent to get my bag to me. Merry Christmas.
Bullet points.
Missing two bags when I arrived
Given PJ's and a toothbrush etc kit (pretty useless. PJs - it is really hot here, wash kit, already have two as I had just spent 26 hours on airplanes!) Nothing for my 2 year old and no timeline given
Number given for contact never picked up (tried at least 10 times and left messages)
One bag finally turns up. Locks cut even though I gave them the code. Why do I even need to jlgive them the code? They locks are part of the bag

Do yourself a favour. Just don't do it. We are now having Christmas day (2 days after landing) with only the Qantas PJs.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Australia's national disgrace. AVOID.,"I bought a Qantas ticket via Trip.com (avoid it, too) with my name spelled wrong. We spotted this error at the counter before check-in, and Qantas didn't want to help me with another ticket, so I lost my flight. The lack of humanity of these people is inexplicable. Qantas, If a customer has a problem with YOUR products, attend to the issue if the customer is right in front of you. I didn't deserve you playing the lousy lawyer game with me. On top of that, an error in YOUR system made me lose a premium seat, and I couldn't get my money back. The food is disgusting. There are no offices at the Brisbane airport and no humans around to even pretend they care about my problems. Without exaggerating, I had to wait 7 hours for someone to reply to the phone. These people are monsters with no soul, and you should avoid them.",April 2022,1,1,2,1,1,5,1,1
1,Last flight with Qantas,"I have flown Qantas exactly twice before in 16 years of living in Australia. Both were domestic flights. The planes were old and service overall bearable. Virgin and Singapore Airlines have been my go to.

Recently Qantas introduced a long haul flight from Sydney to Bangalore non stop. It was attractive and decided to fly the route with my family.

I regretted the moment I stepped in the plane.

In no particular order

1. The toilets werent cleaned and was smelling of piss. No hint of any air freshener, no seat liners.

2. The meal trays weren't cleaned and there were significant sticky food stains from the previous flights

3. The seat pouch was full of dust and and residue from earlier flights .

4. Meal options were unavailable 1/3 of the way in to economy class. Only two options chicken curry and cauliflower curry. Chicken ran out 1/3 of the seats in. So had cauliflower curry. Horrendous mash of god knows what vegetable.

5. Second meal was chicken parm and cauliflower with rice. Two meals on the same flight with same ingredients. I tried the chicken parm, with sweet potato mash and tomato. Couldn't eat it as it was to soggy.

6. my screens and my daughters screen did not respond to touch unless u pushed through wirh all your might. I suspect the screen calibration was off.

7. The inflight meal announcement was made in one of the most funniest Indian accents I have heard. I have never flown in a flight that was so bizzare. Should be introduced to accent neutralisation training.

In all this the crew did the best they could. I appreciate their service.

The experience is more than the crew. I suspect this is the result of cost cutting and the pure pursuit of profit. Qantas knows there is demand and not many options.

Three of us paid approximately AUD 10k for return flights. We just reached Bangalore yesterday and now contemplating cancelling the return and booking the return leg on Singapore Airlines.

I will ever fly Qantas again.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,No Way To Plan With Qantas,"It seems that every time I have flown Qantas recently, they find a way to mess up the schedule, such that it is impossible to plan. We were booked on a 7:30 am flight from Sydney to Melbourne and as it was early, expected plane and crew would be available and departure might be on time. All were on board and fifteen minutes later we were still at the gate and were advised there was a mechanical issue that would take at least 90 minutes to fix, so we off-loaded and were allocated a new flight one hour and one and a half hour later (all done reasonably well). Mechanical issues happen but the plane had obviously flown earlier, or the prior day and you would have thought a mechanical issue would have been corrected overnight. Erratic schedule changes and cancellations and now mechanical issues adds a new level of uncertainty when flying Qantas.",December 2022,3,3,1,1,1,3,4,1
4,Flight experience saved by Paddy !,"We flew from Brisbane to Perth for a Christmas holiday - on flight 939 Dec 21st.
The flight itself was fine, but ... there were issues....
The food was nearing inedible -- not an expectation for the price paid for business class. You could have chipped a tooth on the pasta- dried out, little sauce, little flavor. (We should have had the ""economy class"" bangers and mash!). We have flown on many business class flight on other airlines - and Qantas food sits on the BOTTOM of the list ... come-on Qantas - get your act together !!
The level of cleanliness left much to be desired ... chunky dirt on the screen, and pen scribbles on the chair.
The choice of movies and programs was limited to ""B"" class fair.
The only saving grace was the service provided by the in-flight crew - especially the head steward - Irishman Patrick Ryan. He was excellent in every way! Great job Paddy!",December 2022,4,4,2,5,2,2,5,1
1,Worst experience ever,"I honestly don’t know where to start to describe how bad the experience was. The aircraft was in a desperate need of a refurbishment, one of my arm rests was broken and loose. The in flight entertainment is very old and functioning on and off - mostly off. The food is very basic and parts of the meal will be finished by the time the service reaches you and the staff will simply say “we run out” and you just have to accept that. There is no WIFI - really not acceptable in this day and age. The plane was dirty with food scrums all over and the toilets were smelling of urine so bad I felt sick at some point.
Customer service is appalling throughout. The staff on board behave like they tolerate you at most. One of the flight attendants from Sydney to Singapore literally touched my face with her bottom twice during service and didn’t even acknowledge it. They come with a bag to collect trash and if you are seated on the aisle seat expect to have the trash bag on your face when window and middle seat passengers are putting the trash in. I ended up picking their trays myself so I can avoid the trash bag touching my face. I have applied for an upgrade and it was rejected - I didn’t see that as an issue initially although I have offered very close to the maximum amount. I asked again the ground staff at Sydney about the possibility of upgrading/changing the seat but I was cut off immediately with an “absolutely not, the flight is full”. It was not full - there were many seats available in many areas of the plane and 2 people sitting close to me were upgraded to first class for free in Singapore. No transparency whatsoever (makes you wonder what is really the criteria for upgrades?!) and no attempt to offer basic customer service - I wasn’t expected anything for free.
Genuinely the worst experience ever.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas on par with Jetstar service these days,"Flew Qantas for my holiday in November was meant to fly Brisbane to Sydney then Sydney to Bangkok flight was delayed to Sydney then arrived at Sydney to not even be told our flight was changed and then forced to fly to Singapore and then Bangkok arrived in Sydney for no one to help then to find out our tickets weren’t rebooked properly and then the same thing happened in Singapore tickets were rebooked properly all this was on Qantas arrived in Bangkok middle of the night both suitcases were left in Sydney no compensation was given and apparently I needed to prove I had to buy toiletries and clothes which was ridiculous you lost my bags of course I needed to purchase items! Now this was just all the logistical nightmare of Qantas now to the in flight I was smashed in the head with the meal service trolley and wasn’t apologised to the food was ridiculously sub par and the seating space is just so small, toilets smelt very strongly of urine Qantas has made me truely appreciate the Asian airlines and only ever want to book with them!",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Horrible and Sneaky,"Last Dec 4th during COVID, I was not permitted to enter Australia. I was in Fiji and had to pay out of pocket for an immediate return flight, Which meant I had a credit. I've been in Australia now for 9 months and have to suddenly return to the states to assist a family member with terminal cancer. So I contacted Quantas they gave me a code for the credit and explained that all I need to do when preparing to purchase a ticket was to give them the code and pay the difference. Well the time has come for me to use this ticket so I called gave the code and was told that since I purchased from an agent I had to contact them....now Quantas had took over the ticket from Kayak. I contacted Kayak after spending a day trying to speak with a live representative who told me that Quantas owns the ticket.....after 6 calls and being told by Quantas I'm out of luck financially I reached a Quantas rep who dug deeper and with all my bitching took it upon herself to issue a refund which they processed immediately. Short end Quantas will do all they can not to honor a credit so keep pushing keep calling and do so during the week not the weekend you will speak to whomever wherever and they will hang up on you!!!!! Good luck. I forgot, so sin e they took ownership of the ticket I was held at ransom to pay their rate not the discounted rate I purchased very dirty move.....so do not ontact the airline if you purchased on line or with an agent they will take the ticket and charge you more. I was told by a representative that it's my fault for buying a discounted ticket I replied I'm in hospitality and understand fully that your company uses discounted ti kits to fill your planes as we fill our hotel rooms horrible service.....",March 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Thanks Ping,I would like to thank Miss Ping part of the ground staff at Qantas - Sydney International Airport for her awesome customer service. She made the on boarding experience a delight n ease.,December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,POOR !!,"travelled over on Qatar and would give them 8 out of 10.... but would struggle to give Qantas 3 out of 10
The departures of all 3 flights were delayed. The service I received on the sector Sydney to Singapore was appalling. In flight staff in my area appeared to regard passengers as a nuisance and gave little/no customer service. I had a call button on for over 40 mins as my inflight entertainment wasn't functioning.... it was not answered so I attempted to gain the attention of a passing stewardess and she just put up her hand and ignored me!!! I reported the non functioning system but to no avail. It wasn't fixed whilst in Singapore so i had to travel the whole distance from Sydney to Singapore ( over 22 hours) without one.
Food was served 'McDonald's style' !!! .... no starters or deserts and with wooden ( absolutely dreadful) or plastic ( not much better) utensils and plastic containers for drinks. I asked for a cup of tea as did the person next to me... neither of us received one(Singapore to Londonnsector).
I should make it clear that Qatar presented meals 'old style' with proper meal trays.... starters and deserts...proper utensils and proper glasses.
Charging points in my and the seat next to me were also not working.
When I complained to Qantas they offered 2000 Frequent Flyer points as compensation ( worth next to nothing and a complete insult)
I worked for Qantas many years ago and was proud to do so at that time.
Now.... I would not choose to do so and would not recommend that anyone else do so either !!",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas… you’ve changed,"Whilst Qantas CEOs bucket the millions, customer service has completely gone down the drain.

All I want to do is change a domestic flight in Australia (because the system won’t let me do it online) and I’ve been waiting over an hour to get through! This is not the first time this has happened in the past month!",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Awful Airline,I booked through Expedia and due to a technical fault on the system had to make a minor amendment to a passenger name. I was then advised that Qantas refuse to make any amendment whatsoever resulting in me having to cancel all the flights and rebook. This cost me £600. The customer service was dreadful from Qantas. Their staff are very incompetent and can't wait to get you off the phone. Please avoid this company at all costs. You will regret it and lose money.,December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Who Cares-We Are Only Customers,"There is no joy in bashing Qantas, once a great airline and I doubt anyone at senior manager level in Qantas cares or reads reviews but they should as they might learn how bad the service is and in time they will see the outcome; most businesses who ignore customers fail in time. Despite emails from Alan Joyce claiming the love their customers and the extra points and other platitudes the service has not changed, a classic example of a flight from Melbourne to Sydney. It was scheduled for 7:30 pm and at 5:00 pm on the way to the airport in peak traffic the text came through the flight had been cancelled and we were booked on an earlier flight at 6:30 pm. Great news if we could get there on time, which we did. However the flight departed at 7:10 pm, because the crew arrived at 6:30 around he time of departure with no advice the flight was delayed. Qantas must know a day in advance that they need to cancel flights, or lower prices (now very high) to encourage more users but they leave it and hour and a half before they advice customers of he new flight plans. Imagine the complexity of getting people on different flights, arranging aircraft and crew and dispensing with those that expected to be flying; sounds to me like a giant mess and cost issue. You now cannot plan with Qantas who are totally unreliable but sadly my squillion points keep me with an unreliable and dysfunctional airline. The Business Class lounge is now awful and the bags took 30 minutes to arrive and the one tagged Premium Service arrived last--looks like an Irish picnic to me and someone forgot the purpose.",December 2022,3,3,1,1,1,3,2,1
1,Lost baggage,"Qantas carried us on the last leg of our flight from London to Auckland.they managed to lose our checked in bag,Childs pram and car seat from Sydney to auckland.almost impossible to speak to anyone from Qantas ;,they do not respond to emails and their online lost baggage app is a fake.had to buy a car seat to get ourbaby back from the airport.our pram arrived 7 days into the holiday ,our car seat on day 10 and are still waiting for our checked in bag on day 12 .disgusting treatment of customers.We will never fly Qantas again",December 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Avoid at all costs ! Changed our flights both way so missed both connections,"Don't book with Qantas ! We recently bought a return flight via their website (NOT a third party) with a connection from Sydney to Europe. This was the most expensive flight for our journey, but had the best connection each way. In the end, Qantas changed both our first flights, resulting in missing the connections on the way in and out. We ended up with a 24 hours connection on the way in and a 12 hour connection on the way out. What would have been a very long flight turned into a 3 days nightmare. Needless to say, Qantas did not offer a proper solution or any compensation at all. They just washed their hands and we've been treated as hostages, not customers. AVOID !",December 2022,3,3,3,1,-1,3,1,3

Returned on 18th november with my husband needing help after suffering walking difficulties while on our visit to family. Qantas staff couldnt have been more helpful. We were in premium on our return flight,which helped, but they were absolutely marvellous, arraged help for us and another really good flight with friendly careing crews.

Please move aside (voice dripping in condescension) use the cheat sheet (of course that does not match their web site - does not work) return to counter ""it's not our job to help you"". Well Sarah (Sydney, Q Club) well done, confirmed that once I have used my points I will do everything to avoid flying with Qantas.

1,Refund - not processed for more than 3 months!,"Worst ever customer service. It’s been a nightmare to dealt with to process a refund.

Its now 3 months since I cancelled my flight, rang the airline more than 12 times each time waiting on the line for more than 40 minutes !and each time get a same answer from the consultant that the “refund team has advised you will receive the refund in 6-7 weeks!

After 2 months the answer changed to “ refund team has advised in 3-5 days refund will be back into your account “
then on the third month time changed to “ refund team has advised in 48hr refund will be back into your account!
And here we go! Now after 2 weeks from the last response response, I just have been told that will take 6-8 weeks for my refund to be processed!!!!

This the Answer that I got on day 1!!!!

I have filed a complaint while ago and had no response since!

Have received no response, no email, I would give 0 rating if I could.

Worst ever airline, will never buy again!",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas Customer Care similar to Ryanair?,"The sign of a good airline is how they handle disruptions. Unfortunately, on the 30th November Qantas had a disruption with their QF10 flight from London, and their shabby lack of communications, illustrated to me that in their pursuit of profitability they have forgotten their duty of care towards their passengers.

On the evening of the 29th November, I accessed my booking to ascertain the LHR departure terminal in order that I could book a taxi to the airport. To my surprise, there was a notice advising a 11 hr delay on this flight. Next morning, my booking again showed an 11 hr delay leaving LHR but surprisingly, it was showing the flight arriving on time into MEL with a 12h 05 total flight time! Although, during the day I received several emails from Qantas marketing asking me to purchase their merchandise, there was never any email nor SMS advice received from Qantas regarding this extended delay.

This situation continued until 1800 on the day of our departure, when I received a push notice from Qantas to say they had move my wife and I to the Emirates flight out of London. They also gave us our seat assignment, but when we checked in at LHR, Emirates told us these seats numbers didn't exist on their aircraft. As a result, we were unable to sit together all the way back to MEL.

I believe Qantas should have advised us and the other passengers of the flight delay, rather than leaving us to discover this for ourselves. Apart from the message advising us of the change to Emirates, there was no communications re this flight, received from Qantas.

All in all, after this experience I would rate Qantas as a third world airline with customer service standards similar to Ryanair in the UK.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Disgusting Service.,"We flew Business class from Melbourne to Christchurch and the service was appalling.
To top it off they asked what we'd like to eat, either a beef curry or pork dish. We both said beef curry and when they came to serve it to us they said there's only one beef curry left as the pilot doesn't eat pork and they gave him the other one. WTF?????. Why even tell us that, just say there's only one beef curry left.
Other service issues as well but can't be bothered mentioning them, just don't fly qantas.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Bumped a family off,"I’m writing on behalf of my daughter, son in law ,and two grandchildren. They booked a flight and chose their seats twelve months in advance of flying to the UK for a family Christmas. Less than 24 hours before they were due to fly . They received an email to say the flight was cancelled due to operational circumstances. Lie number 1 . We are on flight radar and the flight was not cancelled. Qantas decided to “ bump off” a family with two children!!! The initial flight was , Melbourne to Perth , Perth to Heathrow. Instead they were put on flights Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Singapore ( around midnight with two tired children) to Heathrow. The first leg of the flight they were split up . It wasn’t until they landed in Sydney did they manage to get seats together for the duration of the flights. Also on the first leg , no meals for the children. These hadn’t been noted for the entire flights until my daughter realised and sorted that out.
Our son in law is a neurologist consultant at the RCH and is a frequent flyer with Qantas travelling the world with his research.
My husband managed to speak with a supervisor who was sympathetic but couldn’t offer any means of compensation and suggested filling in a form as it is impossible to speak to anyone in customer service.

Was charged for 2 extra kgs and the luggage did not even make it on same plane and Qantas refused to refund or offer any discount. Definitely not worth almost $1,000 for a one way flight with this terrible service!! Qantas should be ashamed of their name.

1,"If you can avoid Qantas, please do. They are thieves.","We cancelled this flight a few weeks before it flew, and we're promised a full refund by Qantas (approx. $1260). However, it would take 8-12 weeks to process (incredible given it took 8-12 seconds to take the money from our account).

The 12 weeks passed. No refund. We called in week 13 (each call takes 45 mins plus) and we're told it was imminent, but they were experiencing delays. Nothing came.

We called again at the start of Week 15. They said 'it's been processed right now'. You will receive an email confirming this shortly. We got the email confirming the full refund had been processed and would be in our account in 3-5 working days.

After the 5 working days passed, we have no refund. We called Qantas again. They said 'we've sent the money, it must be with you bank'. We called ANZ - they have never seen any evidence of a payment by Qantas. They provided proof of this.

We called Qantas again, with the ANZ proof. They can't help us, as their records show the refund has been processed, so ANZ must be 'mistaken'.

We know now that after 20 weeks; we're never seeing the money again. Qantas has literally stolen $1,200 from us, as well as making us waste hours on pointless phone calls.

Qantas is obviously a dying airline, and we know in a few years or so we'll get the satisfaction of seeing their corrupt / inept staff being made redundant in their hundreds. That'll help; as will our plan to lodge so many complaints, calls and other communications at Qantas that will we ensure they spend far more than $1200 dealing with us in the long run. But if you haven't ever used them, take our advice and stay far away.

Benefited also by using discounted FF points to secure our seats. Impressed with ease of bag drop and efficient boarding. Fast delivery of luggage on arrival. Enjoyed our on-board snack but it just isn't what it used to be. Comfortable flight throughout and the in-flight entertainment adequate for the journey.

3,No Wifi ??,"We were very lucky, no flight delays or cancellations. Return mel to lax. Flight was ok, bit bumpy as its smaller planes that they are using and no wifi . My friend was in business class and she didnt have wifi either. Flight to LA staff were rude and grumpy, return flight they were nice. Seemed to be very hit and miss when it came to service and food. Considering the price of flights at the moment, I expect better from Qantas .",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas cancels flight and makes us fly with someone else,"Qantas cancelled our direct flight from LA to Sydney a day before the flight and gave us a flight that goes from LA to Melbourne using United Airlines then from Melbourne we will catch a qantas plane to Sydney. They have allowed 1 hour for us to get off the plane go through customs and grab our bags then go to the domestic terminal to check in and catch our flight. I feel that qantas was not very efficient in handling this issue and it feels like they said we don’t care what happens to you as long as we’ve provided you a way home. They were not helpful when we called up about our cancelled flight, the lady on the phone even had the audacity to start yelling at us on the phone, she did not assist us with trying to find a direct flight that will get us home. My partner and I paid for direct flights for a reason and direct flights are more expensive for a reason. We are very unhappy with qantas as our 14-15hour journey home has now become a 20+ hour journey. This is not the service we expect from such a reputable company. DO NOT FLY WITH QANTAS unless you want the headache we’ve had to deal with.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Useless customer services,"I haven’t even travelled yet but so wish I hadn’t booked with Quantas. My original booking was a direct flight to Melbourne with a refuelling in Perth. This was then changed by Quantas to a flight to Perth with a separate flighr to Melbourne five hours later.
I rang Quantas customer services this morning, waiting 40 minutes for my call to be answered. I wanted to make sure that I didn’t have to pick up my bags at Perth and check in to the new flight, as I was presuming it was a connecting flight since I’d booked a flight to Melbourne. At first the agent confirmed that my bags would be checked straight through but then he saw the length of the stopover and said I would probably have to pick up my bags and check in to the new flight. I told him that I was travelling alone and would like a definitive answer. He couldn’t give me that and saud I should check with security staff at Perth. I told him I wasn’t happy with that and asked to speak to his supervisor. I was put on hold and then got a voice message saying that the offices were closed and ai needed to call back. 40 minutes of my life wasted and no further forward n
Apart from how bad customer services is, I don’t think it’s right that an airline can change a single flight to two flights to suit themselves. Not impressed.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

When checking in the morning of flight on way to airport, NO MENTION OF THIS DELAY. Staff at airport were nice and cordial and I think shocked at ineptitude of their airline. Even worse, transfer from Perth to Melbourne which was originally a short wait after LH to Perth, IS NOW AT 3 IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE NEXT DAY. 16 hour overnight wait. Never using this airline again.",December 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,Another long wait,"As there was no other SYD-ADL flight in the afternoon, I had to wait many hours in the business lounge. The menu was ‘all day dining’. Pumpkin and coconut soup was delicious. Unfortunately, as the flight was delayed, I ended up waiting for10 hours and finally on board to Adelaide, which was full. My seat was changed from 2D to 1D. Row 1 has more leg room, but you have to put everything in the upper locker. As I felt cold and began to sneeze, I put on my coat and asked for a face mask. I felt better by eating a hot quiche rather than cold salad.",November 2022,5,4,3,3,3,5,5,4
3,"Food was OK, and cafe brekfast was just enough","When I bought a ticket during the “Together Once More” campaign in March, it was a HND-MEL flight. But only a couple of weeks before the trip, Melbourne flight was cancelled and I was put on the Sydney flight. So the business class on this Sydney flight was full. As I was feeling cold, I asked the customer service manager to raise the temperature. My seat was also 2K, which I found it better than 1K, as the little side table along the isle keeps the seat more private. As I am small, the width of the seat is OK for me to recline to sleep.
I ordered a Japanese cuisine, hoping the main fish dish would be good. But the contents in the Bento box as well as the cooked bonito fish were disappointing. Nevertheless, the little sweets at the end was a real Japanese cake, which I enjoyed.
Prior to arrival in Sydney, they served cafe breakfast. Before the Covid, I got sick and tired of the same cafe breakfast, but for this time I found it just enough and sufficient.",November 2022,5,5,3,3,3,5,5,4
4,Long wait in Qantas First Lounge to Tokyo Haneda,"It was a very long wait in the Qantas First Lounge, where they always treat the customers loyally with the freshly cooked food. I had a pan-fried barramundi with broccolini, crab meet (without pork) on some kind of noodles and green tea. Later, I asked for an ice cream sandwich, that was perfect. Then, I had a nap till boarding in the evening. I want to post this in the Qantas Sydney First Lounge page, but TripAdvisor won’t let me. At least someone who reads this know how good the First lounge is.
My seat on SYD-HND was 2K, second on the right window seat. Width of the seat isn’t as wide as the domestic business class seat. I ordered a Japanese cuisine. Zensai (Entrée) in a bento box was really nice, but I didn’t want to eat the main beef steak. The little desert was not a Japanese ‘kashi’ but a small piece of cheese cake, which was very disappointing
I somehow slept a bit and noticed that the flight attendant began to serve breakfast for those who were already awake. I imagined a small piece of bread and fried eggs, but it was a sandwich of thick bread with tomato relish. So I could hardly eat it, feeling sorry for the people who were hungry in the war-torn countries.",November 2022,5,5,3,4,3,4,5,4
3,Long wait,"I had a relatively long wait in the Adelaide Qantas Lounge, as the 14:30 flight to Sydney was cancelled and I had to be on the 13:30 flight. There wasn’t any more flight until evening. As I needed to eat lunch, but I don’t eat beef. So a kind staff made a cheese and ham toasted sandwich and brought it to me with green salad. The lunch menu for ADL-SYD was either toasted sandwich or spicy beef noodle. As there was no other choice, not even a side salad dish, I had the toasted sandwich, but the bread was very thick! I complained to Qantas several times, they prefer to serve beef and seldom serve hot chicken dish in the business class.",November 2022,4,5,4,3,3,5,5,4
1,Bizarre food menu,"We have flown to Australia many times, mostly in riffraff class. Historically we have used Singapore Airlines and many years ago used Qantas, who were then excellent. We decided to change back to Qantas as the Singapore meal offerings were a little too Asian for us. The experience travelling with Qantas was poor, from miserable ground staff to an even more miserable flight crew. The main menu offering was ‘Plant based food’ ( presumably for the Eco warriors and veggies on board,) or Tofu and noodles (wtf) and beef casserole with Mash. Fortunately we were able to swerve the first two offerings and plump for the beef casserole thingy. Qantas are definitely cutting back on their food, no bread rolls, no cheese and biscuits etc. The food on internal flights we had with Qantas was poor as well,on board aging and tatty airplanes. We flew back home with Emirates, a totally different experience, 100% better than Qantas. Alan Joyce - stop milking the company of millions and try one of your long haul flights to understand why Qantas is going down the pan - and try to speak to anyone at your call centres. Qantas are now nearly as bad as British Airways!!",November 2022,1,1,2,1,1,4,2,1
2,don't fly Qantas to Bali in Business class!,"Had to fly to Bali on a business trip, only there for 2 days. Flew Business class to ensure that I could get some sleep in the plane on the way back as I had to attend a conference on the morning of my return.
Turned out the plane was an old 737-800 which is the same one they use on the run between Melbourne and Sydney. the seats barely reclined and this was nothing like a business class standard seating or space.

1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Our original flight was LAX to Melbourne direct, this was changed to a connecting flight via Sydney to Melbourne. Qantas arranged the connecting flight, allowing two hours from landing at Sydney to transfer. Our flight landed ~15-20 mins late, we collected our luggage and cleared customs etc and got to the Qantas domestic transfer at 9.30am for a 10.30am flight. A good hour before it was due to fly.

We were immediately told we would be missing our flight and would be re-booked onto another one. Despite having an hour to spare! The bag-drop / check-in team at the transfer looked to be deliberately dragging their feet to collect luggage to ensure that no-one could get on their 10.30am syd-melb flight, which was about half the flight from our quick roll-call. Instead of delaying the syd-mel 10.30am flight by a 10mins to get us on board, they rebooked everyone onto later flights, the earliest we heard from our fellow economy comrades was 5pm. We're booked onto a 5.45pm flight to Melbourne, fingers crossed we get home by Christmas. If only Rex flew international.

No apology, no explanations, just 'it is what it is'.",November 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Poor customer service,"Lost luggage for 2 days (which is a very likely occurrence with Qantas these days) and when I wrote back to claim for expenses as suggested by luggage handling team, was awarded A$60 as compensation to be paid upon filling up a pdf claims form. Which was fine until you realise there is no way to send back the form as the email address provided bounces back all response emails. 3 separate and new customer feedback form submissions and two calls to the service hotline later, issue remains unsolved (in fact ignored).

Why bother to put up a semblance of customer service when Qantas is simply going to ignore customers anyway. Will avoid flying with them if I can help it even if it means taking worse airlines. At least I am not paying a premium airfare to be ignored.",August 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Switch to Virgin 10 years go validated,"I wasn't going to write this review, but whilst in the business class lounge I just overheard (sorry!) a person next to me trying to change their flight. More money they were told.
If I was concerned that my switch to Virgin 10 years ago was a mistake then today's experience - as a lifetime Qantas Gold member - dispelled that thought.
Arriving in Auckland from Santiago on LATAM at 5 a.m. in the morning, I tried to jump on the earlier flight to Brisbane from Auckland (instead of waiting for 11 hours) and was told the Bus Class lounge staff can no longer make the changes. I need to contact reservations. Which I did. Then was told to contact my travel agent - at 2 a.m. in the morning Australia time!!
Qantas is no longer an airline friendly to its once stalwart frequent flyers. Long gone are the days of simple flight changes or - yes, I do remember these - free upgrades. Now you struggle to get a flight at a fair price and there's no way to make a change to your booking without a new fee.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Why would you bother with this airline,"Arriving at the airport I was running on time but had not yet checked in. EverytimeI tried to check in it wanted me to download an App. So getting to the airport I tried to check in and there now no facilities to check in at the airport. I asked for assistance as I was running out of time and was basically told "" I am busy, please find some one else or download the App"". I was quite frustrated and attempted the App download. Proceeded with the setup of the App and then got stuck with a clunky App that confused me on how to check in for my flight. I again found some one to try and help me with my check in, and to be told "" there is only a few more minutes left before I check in closes, Sorry but there is nothing I can do for you"". My comment was, ""your are just walking away, your not going to help me?"". The response was, ""yes,
Ring the call centre"". I proceeded to ring the call centre and after 26 mins waiting I was answered by an employee who sounded like they had just woken up, the audio quality was so poor, muffled and full of static that I could barely hear the the helpdesk agent on the other end. To top it off I could hear, the TV show in the background and restless children. After a few minutes of struggling with the sound, the helpdesk just hung up. I had to then ring again and wait another 15 mins to try and get further help.

Then another saying my connecting flight is at risk.I talk to the service desk who tells me I have been rescheduled on a new flight tomorrow at 06:30 from melbourne to Newcastle Qantas has booked a Hotel for me. At the gate the Qantas staff then tell me the Newcastle flight will be held until we get there as there are several Newcastle bound traveler's on the flight from Adelaide. We we eventually get to Melbourne the flight to Newcastle has long since gone. I queue up at the service desk to be handed a new boarding pass with a hotel address scribbled on the back and a note saying I have a $50 food voucher. The flea pit of.

1,Worse flights ever,"We have recently returned from a 6 week holiday in the USA. We elected to fly with Qantas for no other reason than they were the cheapest. Our original flight from Brisbane was due for a 10am departure but the whole flight was cancelled and we were relegated to the ‘red eye’ 10.30pm departure that same night. We had booked overnight hotel accommodation at the airport due to the early departure of the original flight. This accommodation was non-refundable so we lost that when the flight was changed. The aircraft that Qantas is currently using is an A330, which we quickly found was totally unsuitable for a long haul flight. Less leg room, seats didn’t seem as wide, and the aisle was that narrow that when someone walked down it they would bump the aisle passenger. Food was rubbish. Flight attendants sleeping quarters consisted of a curtained off part of the centre seating, amongst all the passengers. There was no are suitable to actually get up and stretch the legs. Overall, this was the worst long haul flight that I have experienced",October 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Average Service,"Used points for short trip to Auckland via Brisbane.
With only 90 minutes between landing in BNE and taking off from international terminal, and knowing of the delays in screening/immigration, I spent 90 minutes and two phone calls (the first one dropped out after 35 minutes and no callback) trying to change to an earlier SYD-BNE flight (there were reward tickets available) only to be told ""75 minutes is enough time"". So arrived at lounge in Sydney and the staff were happy to change the flight for me.

Domestic business class has simply deteriorated - no pre-flight drink and limited choice for breakfast. Flight from BNE to AKL was delayed due to radio issue (they even 'reset' the plane by powering down and then powering up again) followed by another tech issue (""strange fuel usage indicator"") before 40 min delayed take off.

Trans-Tasman business service has also taken a cost-cutting hit. No pre-flight hot towel, limited service options and limited drink choice. Crew did not follow up with any offers of 'top ups' of drinks, basically disappearing into the galley.

IFE is also now worse than most budget airlines. Another cost-cutting measure. Plus no wi-fi in this day and age?

Was looking at using alot pf points on future QF overseas holiday but will now use them on partner airlines. Qantas has gone downhill badly post COVID with cost-cutting all over - except for airline executive bonuses of course.",November 2022,4,4,2,2,1,3,3,2

1,Customer service,I’d like to say the customer service with this airline is absolutely disgusting. Over the past years I’ve noticed the staff and especially cabin crew being more entitled as they come. I was with my grandma who has an accent . As I was in the bathroom a flight attendant asked her if she wanted any beverages and as she said what she wanted she proceeded to tell her to speak “normally” and the overall customer service was disgusting. So rude and entitled I have travelled with multiple airlines such as Garuda and Singapore airlines all with amazing service.

My wife on the other hand was asked “how about Massaman Beef” that in itself tells its own story.

The compensation for the overnight delay was they paid for the nights accommodation and $50 food voucher. The service on board was mediocre and the food would be better not to offer food.

It was an old Dash 8 that were first produced in 1984 by DeHavilland Canada and later by Boeing.On this flight the attendant was not that pleasant and overall, with slow luggae delivery it was not at all pleasant. One day Qantas may once again be a normal airline not a budget disaster that no one can rely on.Until Boarding time departure was at Gate 2 and then switched to gate 22, on the opposite side of the airport-great planning and customer service.",November 2022,3,3,1,1,2,3,2,1
5,Qantas gets it right,"Having read all the bad things about Qantas and Australian international airports. I was full of trepidation prior to our 17 hour Dreamliner flight to LHR. From the moment we checked in everything went smoothly. We arrived 4 hours early and were offered access to the domestic lounge and then assisted with the move to the International Lounge. After a hassle free boarding we settled in to enjoy an awesome meal.Then enjoyed 7 hours sleep on the flat bed.
A light breakfast then exposed to the chaotic
Transfer from LHR 3 to LHR
A horror experience which saw us making our connection with seconds to spare
So bad we will avoid LHR in future

Perth International 8/10

1,Budget service for premium price,"Qantas has gone completely downhill, from service to comfort. This was one the worst trips I’ve ever had, Jetstar would have done a better job if they flew to South Africa. Firstly, there were multiple seats on the plane that were damaged to the point of not being able to be sat on to being duct taped together (I flew premium economy and there were 3 that in that class alone. Secondly, the service was atrocious. We were spoken to and treated as if we were a bother to flight attendants and were constantly told business class to presidente over our requests. The food was also inedible and flight staff took over an hour after service to clear to empty plates. Finally, I saw the economy seats were smaller than that of a budget airline, most people had to walk sideways down the isle because it was so narrow and they do not supply packs with eye masks and toothbrushes anymore for economy flyers. Absolutely disgusting that they charge what they do for what you get. I’ll never fly with Qantas again.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Budget service at a premium price,Another clunky and rattling QANTAS flight with an antique in-flight entertainment system that is barely functioning. The aircraft was old and once again we are paying a premium price for a budget service. The QANTAS brand is no longer appealing.,November 2022,3,2,1,3,2,2,4,2
2,QANTAS should be spelt DELAY,"Possibly not necessarily Qantas fault, BUT.... Original flight CANCELLED, then a 3 hour wait....and more - DELAYED. Ground staff kept us informed which was good (and expected). Return flight also DELAYED, making things difficult to be picked up at the airport. Once in the air, both flights were good with great staff. Biggest problem with Qantas was they cancelled flights that we had arranged pre Covid and gave a credit which NEVER showed up in their online booking system when I tried (and tried, and tried) - credits that I tried to use now that it was possible for us to fly again. Despite numerous calls to Qantas (most either rang out or after long waits, I was hung up on) and unanswered emails, the issue was not resolved so I had to purchase flights without the credit. On our return from the Cook Islands, I again tried and FINALLY found someone who actually cares and they arranged a REFUND of the original flights - to be paid in 8 WEEKS or more. Qantas - you can do MUCH better.",October 2022,3,3,2,2,2,4,3,3
1,Lost luggage nobody cares,"Booked BA flights but got put on a Qantas flight in Singapore. Luggage didn't arrive, apparently one bag has been found but no updates on the website for 24 hours and customer service when they finally answer refuse to help. 48 hours later still only got the clothes arrived in. Disgusting cutomer care",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1
1,And I thought it could not get worse,"It is quite obvious that this airline does not read reviews or really cares what their customers report. The flight was typically late, and customers had to endure an ongoing list of equipment deficiencies including rubbish tucked in seat pockets, filthy table trays and a dysfunctional entertainment system as the Wi-Fi was not operational. The seat in front of me continually moved back and forward as it was not secured correctly. A very budget airline charging a premium price; do not use QANTAS.",November 2022,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2
4,Endless cabin entertainment problems,"Just arrived in Changi on a Qantas A380. The plane is good, the staff are superb but the entertainment system is well past its use by date. On this flight my wife had a headphone failure. My screen was almost useless with no volume control, no function allowing anything other than first screen to be viewed ie no film selection. On search mode the keyboard did not work. We did the reverse journey 7 weeks ago and this time my wife's sound was very poor, and again the screens very insensitive to use. As a final note the bottom of the screens run seriously hot which can't be good on a plane. Come on Qantas you must be able to do better.
Ref QF1 seat 84E.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"DO NOT USE QANTAS IN YOUR LIFE, EVER","The WORST service. Counter check-in staffs are RUDE and very LAZY. I also found them RACIST. They also HAVEN’T REFUNDED my money since I canceled my previous flight, and it has been more than 3 MONTHS (8 weeks as they promised). The CUSTOMER SERVICE took forever to reply to my email; IMPOSSIBLE to call them from outside of AUS. I called numerous times but still haven’t gotten my issue resolved.
This is by far THE WORST airline service I have ever experienced. Avoid Qantas in your life. And for all the Qantas crew reading this, you suck, man. Improve your quality of service and train all your staff to be more FRIENDLY to the customers. Train your customer service and refund management to be MORE RELIABLE.",July 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Qantas is not the old qantas,"We travelled from Cairns to Vancouver and return with Qantas. We were disappointed with the state of the planes and the lounges. Both need an overall , looking very sad, lounges need a thorough clean and update, armrests on the planes taped up with masking tape, some seats unusable , footrests worn in premium economy. The CEO gets a bonus which should be directed to updates of planes and lounges and more staff employed. Overall the staff were good but the Qantas song rings hollow in the current state of the company. Sydney airport is another story trying to get through security with the excessive lines- realise not Qantas fault but all leaves a bad taste and embarrassment for Australians . Other countries do it much better..
We try to support Qantas but things need to improve.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Excellent experience,"We had a set of 6 internal flights booked with Qantas and they all went without a hitch. Flights were clean, on time and with happy and helpful crew members. Qantas certainly helped our holiday to become memorable for all the right reasons.",October 2022,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,4
1,Standard crappy service,"Got to the airport and realised that my tickets had been booked incorrectly. I take the blame for that and go to the Qantas desk where there are 4 people working only to be told they don’t change flights they do other stuff as one of them said. I then had to call reservations which as anyone who has made that call knows how bad the service is there.

Anyway long story short not one person could help me and I missed the available flight that was still an option due to the stuffing around I got",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,I Blame the Leprechaun!,"It all comes back to Management (or lack of), the CEO shed staff left, right & centre and now can't get them back! But he still gets his $$$ bonus?? With next to no staff the check in had several self serve kiosks u/a, half the bag check in units u/a & operating slowly. The flight was delayed due to a self serve check in being incorrect and a valid passenger only allowed to enter a FULL plane at the last minute. Yes Qantas overbook every flight nowadays! Flight crew were friendly & trying their best but are hamstrung by executive decisions! 20 blokes boarded but only 19 bags arrived in Sydney, again staff issues. The clincher was on noting the missing bag, he joined a line at the baggage handling section which was short staffed and it took 75 minutes to get to front of line to find out his bag was enjoying a Melbourne sojourn!! All up we spent nearly two hours waiting to leave on our charter bus, an hour more then the flight time!! Joyce is a joke and the sooner he departs for the Emerald Isle the better for Qantas & staff & customers!!",October 2022,3,3,1,1,3,3,2,2
1,Worst airline I’ve flown with,"I did not chose to fly with Quantas, Emirates had changed for my last flight and I can say I will never be travelling with them again! After a long haul flight I get to NZ to hear Quantas staff have left behind myself and 20 others suitcases and could not locate and send on the next flight. They told us it could take a couple of days to get our bags back, I have everything I need in my bag including car/house keys, important medications. I also cannot start my travel without my bag. A credit or something from quantas would be nice but nothing, never again!",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
3,They got us there,"Well, the good news is that they got us there albeit late. The snack on board was a tasty pie. Staff on board were mediocre and left rubbish clean up until last 20 minutes of the flight. For once priority bags came off first in Sydney. We got there but Qantas are no longer a premium expensive. We used a credit voucher for this flight and now have no further reason to fly them again.",November 2022,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,5
2,"Nice flight staff, awful baggage handling","Flew through Sydney back to Auckland in early September.
The flight itself was great, but my suitcase is now a write-off.

The polycarbonate shell somehow ended up split - I'm assuming the suitcase took a bit of a drop.
It's a 78cm checked-in suitcase, so was around NZD 300.

The resolution process was a delight - took merely 2 months to reach a claim outcome of $75.
I called in at 25 days and was advised to buy a new one and that I'd be reimbursed for the cost - apparently not.

I received one outcome saying I filed the claim too late, so I had to call and speak to someone for an hour before they advised me to open a new claim.
Their system decided I'd taken a domestic flight - ah yes the country of Australia and NZ...

Finally, after following up with a couple more hour-long calls, it seemed to be going somewhere, only to get an outcome literally less than minimum wage for the time I'd spent following this up.",September 2022,3,3,3,3,2,4,5,4
1,Stolen money,Tried to purchase flight online money taken from my bank account but flight was never booked as Qantas had a system error 7 people I have spoken to in order to get my money back and the latest email told me that they weren't going to refund my money. How can an airline just keep customers money and not book the flight then refuse to refund this is basically fraud why is nothing done. So disgusted,November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Qantas very poor service these day .,"The aircraft staff are great , the new customer service and platinum so called service is terrible , after 23 years of flying with Qantas i am extremely disappointed as a Platinum member and life time gold i have supported qantas .

Purchased three business class tickets prior to covid close down my points are the following .

1 . I had to pay $2000 extra to use the first ticket which i understand prices have changed . I tried to change the ticket by 4 days and am told that will be $2080 is this fair ?.

2. I tried to book again and use the next credit ticket and was told its $5000 extra is this fair .

3. it was cheaper to book with 4 other airlines end up with Cathy pacific at $5700 total business class instead of $8500 with qantas .

4 . tried to book europe for next July premium economy the ticket is $6800 i booked with Emirates at $4500 and had the option of 3 other airlines at the same prices .

5. tried to use qantas points and its impossible to get flights .

6. Called platinum service regarding the Japan 4 day ticket change and the person on the phone didn't care just said if you want to pay i can change if not sorry i cant help you and wanted to charge me extra for a flight i was not changing that was $1200 the other $880 dollars was for the flight i wanted to change .

7. in general they dont care they dont honour the tickets they sold me , i was good enough to leave these in credit as i thought it would help them , but i was wrong .

23 years i will use my credits and fly with other companies and so will my 10 staff .

1,Awful experience and service,"My flight was delayed multiple times, all at the last minute. I was scheduled to fly from Wellington to Sydney. Late at night, I received a notification saying that the flight has been delayed, which meant I will miss my connecting flight from Sydney to Singapore. I was later put on another flight 2 days later out of Wellington, and with an additional connection at Queenstown. Unfortunately, when I got to Queenstown the flight was delayed yet again by another 2 hours. The flight delays totalled almost 3 days. No response from Qantas customer service for months. After complaining 3 times, I received 5,000 Qantas points for my trouble. Whoopdeedo.",July 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Very pleasant airline experience,Very pleasant service. The check-in service was smooth and the lady helping out with the check-ins was helpful. The customer and food service was great. There was in-flight entertainment.,October 2022,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,5
1,"""Forgotten"" Refund","Tickets were booked months in advance. A change had to be made for one passenger name shortly after booking and a new ticket was booked for this passenger. Advice at the time was that the refund would take 6-8 weeks.
8 weeks later we rang to ask about the refund. Turns out Qantas had ""forgotten"" to cancel the incorrectly booked ticket and had ""forgotten"" to process the refund.
Now we have to wait another 8 weeks to see if they remember this time.
I never thought I would say this but there is an airline more dysfunctional that Jet Star.",November 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1
1,Avoid at all costs,"So I booked a 2 way ticket form Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane for a very short trip of 1 week. First my bag did not arrive on the same flight and it took 2 more days to receive it so no clothes and personal stuff for the first 2 days.
On return flight, checked in my luggage in Perth with no issue regarding the weight and size. Lots of issues on the flight from Brisbane to LA. First 1 sick crew member and a passenger that forced an emergency landing in New Caledonia which is understandable however very disorganized planning led to many terrible situations itemized below;
1- took 3 hours for medical team to check on sick passengers before evacuating them from the aircraft which could happen first thing without wasting time
2- Pilot announced a few crew members will pass the allowable limits of working hours if they want to continue to LA so we have to back to Brisbane after almost 8 hours. This means QANTAS is burning out the staff to the bone by giving back to back shifts where a 3 hour delay will cause an over limit working hours.
3- some other technical issues that we had to fly over Brisbane for another 4 hrs to get rid of the fuel for whatever reason that they did not tell us.
4- almost 15 hours wasted and we are back in Brisbane airport and had to wait 2 hrs in a line to get a hotel voucher. Terrible planning
5- booked on another flight and during check in, the staff refused one of my luggage saying it is over weight by 500 grams!!!! Made me to remove the stuff from my luggage with the fact that in the original check in in Perth, there was no issue with the weight and they have caused lots of stress and pain with their service and now 500gr is a deal breaker.
6- lost a day at work and the whole joy of my trip turned into nightmare just because QANTAS does not have a competitor and they can treat customers like this
7- I am Australian living in the US but will never consider a visit until another airline like Virgin Australian operates in this route.
Bottom line, do not waste your time, money and vacation with QANTAS",October 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Bad food for vegetarians,"Last time I traveled on Qantas I was impressed with the service and the food that was on QF9 from perth just before the pandemic.

But this time the food was appalling I can’t even find words to describe what my meal was it was a mixture of some beans and gunk o out 10 millimetres thick.

We are vegetarians Qantas needs to be told there is distinct difference between vegetarians and vegans,

We only had the vegan option why don’t they have a vegetarian option.

I don’t know if Qantas is cutting back on their budget or just have a poor choice of caterers.",October 2022,4,4,4,4,3,5,5,1
1,BOYCOTT QANTAS FOR DISCRIMINATING DISABLED OLD PASSENGER!,Absolutely Disgusting behaviour from Qantas staff towards a disabled 76 year old passenger travelling from Singapore to London Heathrow all we asked was for the passenger to be allocated a extra legroom seat which we agreed to pay extra money for I spent 4 hours during the night from 1:10am-4:35am trying to explain the most simplest basic option of getting a legroom seat for the wheelchair passenger travelling there after spending 4 hours there have still not resolved our case and our 76 year old passenger is left with no suitable allocated seat I urge everyone to Avoid and boycott Qantas for there disgusting behaviour towards a elderly wheelchair bound passenger the staff repeatedly disconnected the phone line knowing that all we were trying to do all night was to get the 76 year old passenger a seat with legroom at our own cost Qantas staff did absolutely nothing to help our situation we will be seeking legal advice from our civil case lawyer and we will be taking further action necessary,November 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,Should have been exceptional,"Was looking forward to flying again in business. Check in was fine with a very helpful woman who cared about her job. Lounge was mediocre, that is in another review. Flight was on an A330 with great seats with loads of space. Food was exceptional, the entertainment of a good quality. Good seat and when fully reclined was a delight. Only issue I had were two cabin attendants who were rude at best and took an instant dislike to my wife and myself. One of them was down right rude and uncivil. We are not frequent flyers with Qantas and the level of service they gave to other customers was very different. These two should look at what they give in customer service because in my book, it was very little. The other cabin attendants were professional and were willing to help.",August 2022,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5
1,Very rude airline staff,"Very rude staff on Sydney to New Delhi flight . Seen staff arguing uselessly with almost 6 people in my cabin including me. Almost all of staff with mask below nose. No etiquette whatsoever regarding customer service. Felt like being on a hijacked flight through the whole journey. An old couple in front of me accidentally pressed call button twice, got scolded like unimaginable.
Never again. Qantas has gone down the drain that quickly, can't imagine.",March 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,The Airbus A330-300 Qantas Business Suite,"This flight QF145 to Auckland was in a Qantas Airbus A330 -300 Business class suite. This product is very comfortable on longer flights as opposed to the Boeing 737 business class seats.

There are 28 business class suites arranged in a 1 -2-1 configuration. I chose a suite with the seat up against the window that offers more privacy as opposed to every second suite being closer to the aisle.

The suite has plenty of storage space , power outlets for charging devices , a light and a mid size inflight entertainment screen with plenty of movies , TV shows etc to keep you entertained . Complimentary headsets are provided however I always use my own.
A small bottled water is also provided in the suite.

The seat reclines to a fully flat bed but I did not use this on this daytime flight that was just over 3hrs.

A welcome drink was offered before take-off and shortly after reaching cruising altitude the lunch service commenced .

I chose the beef brisket for lunch from a choice of two meals offered. Bread and a chocolate cup cake were also part of the meal service along with complimentary drinks. Snacks and other drinks were continually offered through out the flight.

The staff were very accommodating without being obtrusive and provided excellent service during the flight.

A solid business class product that I enjoy utilising on longer flight segments.",July 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Massive delays, seat and bookings","On 20th October a flight planned for over a year to see my family in Perth, was delay by 36 hours. It was just one big delay but time kept changing and so my arrival plan had change, losing money on hotel. In regards to seat I spent extra £100 for extra leg room by doors over the wing, but this were people gather for excise the chat, had foot step on many time and should knock all the time. Had to seat with feet tucked in. For return qantas just changed it from direct flight to London to be via Singapore with no notice, only knew as I was checking qantas app. So much stress and anxiety caused",October 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Hopeless feeling that we will never get our refund,"We booked 11 months ahead and reserved extra legroom seats. Two days before we flew we noticed we did not have those seats - but we had never been contacted. When we asked for a refund at the airport they told us to do it online ourselves. There has never been an apology for the poor way we were cared for - I felt like I was an intruder.
So we have applied online and waited 8 weeks, and then again applied online and waited. And then called and told to wait two more weeks - and then called……… you know where this is going hey?
So Qantas have had our $1385.00 for a year and two mo two months now - we cannot seem to get any traction and they go ahead as if we don’t exist. Soooooo frustrating - will be an ambassador now for people not to fly with Qantas. At least I can vent here hey?",August 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Disappointed and quite anxious,"My husband and I booked a multiple stop, return ticket to Oz with the first flight travelling Dreamliner direct from Heathrow to Perth. We booked window & isle seat, we wanted extra leg room but not available, although it was for the 4 other flights. We leave in 2 weeks and my husband checked this week to see if extra legroom was now available. Not only was it not available but Qantas have moved us from our booked seats of window & isle to the centre row!!! He has called customer service twice who cannot/will not help. They say if we want extra leg room we must upgrade. We asked how much but they say they cannot tell us, and cannot upgrade the one flight, we must upgrade on all flights?!! We have extra legroom on the 4 other flights so don’t need to upgrade on them. They’re not interested, won’t help us, an absolute outrage on a 17 hour flight. My husband is 6’3” so It’s not going to be a fun ride for him or the passenger with the misfortune to be sat in front of him as they will certainly not be reclining their seat with his legs shoved into their back. Will NEVER book with Qantas again.",October 2022,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,3
1,"Shocking queue at checkin, seats uncomfortable & food inedible","Avoid Qantas. I booked in good faith - thinking what better way to get to Australia from London than on their flagship airline. No. Asked to checkin at LHR 4 hours before flight - ok - but checkin didn't open until an hour after we got there - so over 300 grumpy people waiting to checkin at LHR & when they did eventually open checkin there were only 2 desks! Appalling. Security - not Qantas responsibility - was also inexplicably long. Seat was uncomfortable at best - food was totally inedible with ""meat"" that looked like gristle. Couldn't eat anything - even the plastic wrapped cake was dry! I'm dreading my flight home again - guess its just 24 hours of suffering for the sake of visiting one of the most beautiful countries in the world. These airlines need to remember that passengers are paying customers & we deserve to be treated with dignity & respect!",October 2022,3,2,3,2,1,1,1,1
1,Worst customer service I have ever encountered,"BEWARE having to deal with Qantas customer service on the 13113 number. Have been given incorrect advise every time. Because people were complaining about how long it was taking for calls to be answered they employed a whole swathe of new people in Manila and Suva that have no training or authority to deal with issues. (not blaming these people as they are mostly pleasant) Was told it would cost $99 to cancel, then told 500, then told won't cost anything, but now I am told it's $2000 and Qantas have on sold my tickets for a far higher price and wont book us on a different flight. No money has been refunded either. They will not let you speak to a supervisor no matter how much you beg. 28 calls later I am still getting nowhere. Honestly if you have the choice book a different airline until Qantas fix the mess they are currently in. I can't even fit in all the other issues I have had with them but it is not an overstatement - it really is appalling customer service these days.",September 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,PROBLM CHECKING IN,"my y wife and i, plus our kids had bookings from Auckland to manila on the 22nd September



We arrived at the airport by 4am, for a 6am flight, however when we arrived we were told there was an issue with payment on the tickets, and could not fly at that time.

I was advised to go home and call Qantas, which did several times, and kept getting cut off. The last person I spoke to said someone would call me back, which has never happened.


i explained I Hd confirmTION EMil nd eticjets, the status showed as confirmed, so how could there be an issue with payment?

If there was an issue with payment how were we able to get these?



Athe booking were made by a relative in the Philippines using an Amex card, and he has shown me his bank statement showing the payment to Qantas, so I am confused what the issue was.



On my last call to qantas, I was told we were marked as a no-show, which is 100% incorrect, and that comment was an insult to me. I ended up making new bookings for the 23rd of September, and we were able to fly. However I am now out of pocket by the costs of the new bookings(7000NZD0 and completely disappointed by the handling of this.",September 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5,Changed to a long flight,We had booked ASP-PER but in the meantime the route had been cancelled so we were offered ASP-SYD-PER. So this was comfortable and efficient- a hold up on the bags at PER but that was not Qantas fault ( indeed we made a 35 minute transit at SYD with checked luggage) - all in all very pleased. Thanks Qantas,September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
2,Customer Services badly in need of improvement,"I am notoriously early at the airport to have enough time for check-in, security etc. Now when getting my boarding card at the check-in, the card already shows that the flight departure for Melbourne (where I had to catch my connecting flight to Darwin) was significantly later, meaning I would not catch my connecting flight in Melbourne to Darwin. But the staff did not care about the fact that I had to catch a connecting flight and did not try to book me on another flight, althoug there were other flights from Perth to Melbourne on the same day that would have enabled me to catch the Darwin flight. Instead, I arrived late in Melbourne, the flight to Darwin was gone and I had to put up with rude staff of Qantas ""Help Desk"" at Melbourne airport who booked me into a crappy, run-down hotel on Tullamarine instead of the hotel right across the Melbourne terminal. And then, despite having booked business for the whole distance, they gave me an economy ticket for the flight to Sydney (from Sydney to Darwin was business class). Sorry, for that kind of money, the service quality and organization is really disappointing. And the staff on the airplane, well, they should get some training from Qatar or Singapore. Sorry, but simply forgetting to serve me my dinner is pathetic and needing a reminder is just atrocious. That airline needs to improve in so many ways. Sad, but true. And when you very politely point out that they created the problem, they get rude and aggressive. The only saving grace was that the airplanes were at least clean and in OK shape and the food was OK.",October 2022,4,4,3,2,1,4,2,3

3,"The Good, the Bad and the Terrible","Return trip back to Sydney on an older 737-800 out of Perth.
Good
- airport checkin, security and boarding all great - no hassle,
- left pretty much on time and arrived Safely - pretty much on schedule MOST IMPORTANT aspect.
- flight over for most smooth only minor trubulance
- seat comfort much better than on the flight over, which was on a newer plane.
- crew onboard were fine and no issues or concerns in this area.

Bad
- for a 4-5hr trans Australia trip this plane did not have any onboard entertainment, it does have Qantas entertainment on their app but doesn't help if you don't have a pad or suitable device (mobile at a pinch),
Can't understand why they would use this aircraft on these longer legs, should be confined to shorter<3hr legs better 1 1/2hrs. You can travel international in less time than across Australia.

Terrible
- food or the lack thereof - pretty full flight and I'm sure Qantas would have been aware of number of passengers on their plane but when it came to food service ran out of choice around row 22/23 and left passengers with only one option - pretty abysmal
- Got Worse - the two main meal offerings were a Chicken Salad or ""PORK"" sausages - could not fathom why on a two option meal selection Qantas would even consider making one of those choices PORK. Given the diverse customer base it was completely insensitive for Qantas to offer PORK option and this automatically negated any choice for persons of varying faiths or beliefs from any choice eg Halal or Kosher..
Qantas should seriously look at their menu offerings as it would have been just as easy to offer a Lamb or Beef option which would likely satisfy most (not all) customers needs.

Not being subject to Halal or Kosher requirements due to religious reasons but someone who does not in general eat Pork - it left only a couple of packs of Rice snacks and an apple as the dining option - this was not a Lone Wolf matter as the two elderly passengers adjacent also found themselves nibbling on rice crackers.
The chicken option would have been fine but as they ran out of choices - not an option.

Qantas should review their menu offerings.",October 2022,3,3,1,3,3,3,4,1

On all flights the staff were wonderful. They were not aware of my grief and the sadness associated with my visits. However their kindness and good service lifted a heavy load from me. Thank you especially to Janey.

I am sure lots of people travel for sad reasons and it is nice to know that QANTAS staff continue to help others, often perhaps without realizing it.",October 2022,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5
1,Airline cancelled flights the. Surcharged £1200 on balance of the booking,"Appalling customer service. We will be visiting from U.K. staying with family in Perth , and had booked a flight from Perth to Hobart as part of the trip. Qantas cancelled the flight and offered alternatives that were not direct to Hobart. These were unacceptable as I have back problems and specifically needed direct flights to avoid additional transit stops. Qantas are aware of this as on the international flights I have wheelchair assistance.
We declined the alternative flights Qantas then recalculated the cost of our whole trip and charged us a further £1200 for the privilege of them failing to supply the original flights booked in good faith. Appalling customer service.",October 2022,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,What happened to you Qantas?,"My business class flight was worse than any economy flight I've ever been on in my life (and I've been on many!) apart from the one time I was forced to fly with Aerosvit (the now defunct Ukrainian flight with the rudest, most surly, unhelpful staff ever). The staff smiled, and the call bell worked, which were the only two things better than Aerosvit. No drinks were served upon boarding. Couldn't get a flight attendant's attention until an hour and a half into the flight (my seat and tray were filthy and I wanted some wipes so I could clean them). I used the call bell, and the light was on, but they were too busy chatting and simply ignored it. Meat stew -- at least, I think it was supposed to be meat -- was cold and unidentifiable with only partially cooked rice (not joking, I couldn't eat it and nor could the person across from me) and looked worse than anything I've ever been served with them on economy pre-pandemic. The economy food pre-pandemic was ten times better than this muck. I can't imagine that the economy passengers got anything worse, it's just not possible. Really small portion too, with just a tiny bit of fruit and a cracker with cheese. I was really hungry the whole flight. Only wine, beer or water options available. Was told accommodation was arranged for me due to the flight suddenly being split across two days (the flight had already been changed 6 times prior to that, with the return portion leaving from a different city and with the first leg leaving after the second) and surprise, surprise it wasn't. She told me to go to the Qantas desk after I arrived but it was closed. I think the flight attendant already knew that, but was just trying to fob me off because she didn't want to have to deal with organising anything. Wasn't allowed to stay in airport as it closed so had to traipse around in the dark at close to midnight trying to find something. Felt totally unsafe. Cheapest option I could find at such late notice was AU$225(!) because everything else was fully booked. The list goes on. Even the business lounge was serving old fruit salad (the fruit was brown and I didn't trust it) and cold, stale pizza that looked like it had been sitting there a loooong time. Meanwhile Qantas is boasting about how well they are doing financially and paying celebrities to take part in expensive ads. Have been trying to get a reimbursement for the accommodation for over half a year now. Nowhere to upload the form, can't speak to anyone. You literally get put on hold for around 4 hours only to get cut off when the 'transfer' you to another department. Qantas, you are alienating every single loyal customer you ever had. At least those flying domestically. I've heard so many horror stories. I'm not exaggerating or making up anything here. These things all happened. I know it's been a tough couple of years but you are showing absolute disdain for the people keeping you in business. Not good enough! Never again!!!",March 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

Happy to report for the trip over Qantas delivered by getting us all over on time and safe on ground- tick 1. Checkin at SYD no probs (Sunday) sailed through security with no fuss - tick 2. Nice snack and drink before boarding on time - tick 3. Flight over smooth and uneventful - tick 4. On flight crew great with friendly service - tick 5. Lunch meal on route not too shabby and pretty nice,throw in some wine, tea/coffee and water just great - tick 6. Seat space and comfort well fell down here with pretty tight spacing for 5hr flight but seat for me very uncomfortable across back, too low one if not worst economy seating experience, others didn't find the seat quite as poor - ""X"".

We try to call Qantas many many times since almost 1 month.

No luck tried to contact Qantas and finally got through to their French customer service who told me our flight number had been changed. Made the booking and had to pay for our seats , no tickets arrived. 25/06/2022 called Qantas at Heathrow and was told had to pay an increase in the cost for the new flight, still no tickets. 26/05/2022 called Qantas again told the payment was not accepted, Rang our Bank, was told Australain Banks do not comply with European bank legislation for online transactions. Called Qantas ag
again and advised them would fly to Heatgrow on 01/06/2022 to pay in person at their service desk. No service desk but did manage to pay. Added expense off £748.44 Still awaiting reply from Qantas head office about our Complaint.

3,Return from Perth disappointing,"Virtually ignored on boarding, no offers of drink although I noticed the flight attendants handled around water. Compared to my flight over from London to Perth where the flight attendant introduced herself, offered champagne.
Entertainment was super but cabin service was poor, I called to ask for a coffee and again was asked “ did you mean to call me “ not “ how can I help you” so the coffee was given by a sullen attendant in a paper cup, instant coffee. Again compared to the flight out where the flight attendant on noticing I was awake, offered me coffee and it was a perfect cappuccino with a little chocolate.
Come on QANTAS lift yo game!",October 2022,5,4,5,1,1,4,2,1
4,First flight since 2019,"I know Qantas have been taking a bit of a bashing recently but my experience flying business class from the Gold Coast to Sydney in late May 2022 was as good as ever and a great first flight after not flying for about 30 months due to Covid.

Checking in took no time at all but was a little disappointed that even though I was on the one ticket from the Gold Coast to Sydney to Tokyo to London with Qantas and JAL I wasn’t able to check my luggage in all the way to London as even though my layover in Sydney was about 15 hours as it was overnight they just said no.

The lounge at the Gold Coast airport was about as crowded as I have ever seen it but I managed to get a seat and whiled away the 90 minutes or so before boarding. The food and drinks on offer are fine given that most people using the lounge are only taking a relatively short flight.

Boarding was orderly and at the Gold Coast airport they usually use both the front and rear doors to board. I guess they are still in Covid mode as no predeparture drinks were offered.

The crew were friendly and given the flight is blocked at 1 hour 20 minutes and you are probably in the air for an hour they do a great job serving a full hot meal and bar service and the food was great. The seat was the standard 737 business class seat and is fine for the flight to Sydney.

The only downside was that my luggage even though it had priority tags on it seemed to take ages to arrive but that wasn’t the end of the world.

A pretty good start for my trip to Europe.",May 2022,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,5
1,Double charged and won’t refund,"Booked my flight on qantas website, unfortunately the money for the flight was taken out twice. Thought I would be able to call quotas and quickly sort it out but I was very wrong. Have spent over 20 hours on hold and on calls with the contact centre. They keep saying that the refund payment will be processed within so many working days but each time it never arrives and the call centre blames it on the last person I spoke to. It’s been 6 weeks and still have not received the money they took from my account back. Worst customer experience I have ever received.

1,Left Stranded,"Absolutely appalling 'service' provided.
Booked a 'round the world' ticket - BNE to LAX, ATLA to LRH & LRH to BNE.
Due to some unforeseen circumstances I had to call them to find out if I cancelled the last flight, what credit/refund amount I would be given.
Called and spoke to someone who was clearly working from home (dog barking in the background), asked them what cost I would get back, he told me $3,700 - I told him this was incorrect as that was the cost of my 3 flights and I had utilised 2 of them already. Upon asking him to check again, he said the same price. No way was this correct so I told him to leave my booking as it was - NOT to cancel my flight and I would call back later. 10 mins later, I check my booking and it no longer exists! Called straight back and was advised he had cancelled my flight - asked to be put straight back on it, no luck, it was now fully booked!
After several phone calls with different agents, the following morning someone told me they had put me back on the flight (after being told multiple times it was not possible) - but I was now back on the flight, booking had reappeared and my seat selection etc all there.

Fast forward a week, 24hrs before take off, try to check in online. Can't. It's already 10pm so I figure I will call in the morning. I call in the morning, advised that I am on the flight, I just need to check in at the airport. Asked the agent to re-confirm this. She said, yes all fine. But didn't sound sure. I asked her to check the manifest and make sure I am on the flight, 100% - after being on hold, told no, I am not on the flight! My only option was a $855 refund. Note, flights to BNE from LRH were now $3,000 each way!
Asked to urgently speak to a supervisor as I am meant to be flying that evening. Advised they only had one and she was on another call, could they call me back? Bare in mind, I had been told before I would be called back and the call never came. So I remained on hold, 2hours later finally speak to a supervisor. She advised I could now only get a refund of $823. Told her this was not acceptable and she needed to figure out a way to get me home or refund me enough to get home. She told me she needed to look into it and would call me back in 1hr.
Over an hour later, she calls me back with 2 options, the $823 refund or I can get the next available flight, almost 2 weeks later(!) but it would cost ME $2,000!
Told her no, Qantas pay for my new flight home or refund me an appropriate amount to get me home. She advised she couldn't authorise this and that someone from higher management would call me at 9pm that evening to speak to me. Again, bare in mind I am supposed to be flying home at that time!
Conceded that I wasn't going to get any help until someone from management called me back, I agreed to this. She said in the meantime to fill in a customer service form online and someone would be in touch that way too.
Did anyone call me? What do you think...?
I filled the form in on the 20th Sep, still no one has come back to me. Emailed them yesterday (13th Oct) stating someone needed to call me back by the end of the day. Did they? Again, what do you think...?
Beyond frustrated and left stranded, I booked my own flight home via the cheapest option.

Still NOTHING from them - out of pocket thousands of dollars because THEY CANCELLED MY FLIGHT WITHOUT PERMISSION!

Disgusted doesn't even cover it.

I will put this review EVERYWHERE until it prompts someone to call me back and arrange a refund of the cost of my new flight, the (ridiculous) amount they said they could refund me and the cost to make the international calls.

I'm waiting Qantas and very much look forward to hearing from you soon with apologies and a refund.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1

1,Qantas are now dead to me - never again,"Qantas are now dead to me – I will never use them again unless I absolutely have to. That might not seem a lot to some people, but I have been flying with Qantas since 1980s – domestic and international – both a Frequent Flyer and Qantas Club member – for a massive number of flights (over 1000). Last time we flew Qantas overseas (2018) it was a bit of an issue – and the problems we had were never answered. Since then we flew Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. Due to Covid, I had a heap of Qantas points saved up from credit card purchases since 2018 so I used them all up for our first overseas flights. I sincerely regret that and will never make that mistake again. The problem is customer service – not the pilots, planes or schedules. I had an airport logistics issue that needed addressing (yes it is serious) and the local airport has been very helpful, but to get it completely sorted I had to talk to Qantas. All weekend I tried – web and phone – no one was able to help – because it was the weekend was main excuse. IMO their whole customer service 'front end interface' is about getting callers to use the website (and piss off). I tried again this morning (Monday) and after waiting nearly 15 minutes on the QC/FF number, I was given a recorded message from a non-english speaking person (probably overseas call centre) – ""we are upgrading our system, please call back after few hours"" – they then terminated my call. So I rang the specific 'Qantas Customer Care' number and after being on hold for 21 minutes I explained my problem. I was told that I had to call 'Qantas Agency Direct'. I tried the number they gave me and it didn't work, so I found the number online, and they will only speak to registered IATA members (Booking Agents). So I rang back the Qantas Customer Care number again and after being on hold for 27 minutes I advised the problem, and after waiting another 10 minutes the operator solved the problem for me (I hope). When the call ended I was asked to rate the call – the ratings I gave were about the operator and I gave the highest rating. But I bet the general manager of 'customer service' uses those ratings to say their service is good for his/her bonuses – but it is total crap – I was just lucky to get a good operator. Qantas = best pilots, best planes, best maintenance – WORST customer service. The majority of people want customer service first – there are so few airline disasters these days – extremely rare for any of the big carriers. No more Qantas.",October 2022,3,3,3,1,1,3,1,2
1,Low quality airline - stay away,Extremely low quality airline. They lost our luggage 40 days ago and they still did not pay the reimbursement. Stay away from Qantas.

2,Food poisoning a real risk flying through Dubai,"Four of us received serious food poisoning by the time we landed in Europe. A similar event happened to us in 2019, my companion spent three days in bed at a German Hotel. This is a passenger and food safety issue which needs to be treated more seriously by both airlines (Emirates and Qantas). While passenger lives are at risk, we are forced to communicate with web portals and file reference or case numbers, which result in a standard robotic answer that denies fault or a need for action. I have to return to Europe in two weeks and I am quite concerned about any future connections thorough Dubai.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,APPALLING CUSTOMER CARE! Qantas makes the mistake and I have to pay for it!???,Qantas staff cancelled entire leg of travel by mistake. Admitted liability but did nothing! Spent over 12hrs by phone to try to urgently reinstate but calls were disconnected after average on hold for 45 mins. No customer service and no continuity between CSOs (when you could get one). Numerous continual attempts to try to rectify situation with promises to help but only remedy was to complete complaint form! Left stranded in the USA and unable to return home. We had to find an alternative route ourselves at enormous extra cost. No responsibility or care from Qantas. No point of contact except customer care number which goes unanswered or disconnects.

1,Kafkaesque experience trying to book a flight with Qantas,"I attempted to book round trip from Vancouver to Perth online on the Qantas website, paying for it partly with a credit I had from a Qantas flight cancelled because of Covid and the remainder with my credit card. I selected flights and filled in my particulars, but despite references on the website to an option to apply such a credit to my payment that would appear on the payment panel, the only option presented was to pay with a credit card. I called Qantas to try to determine how to apply the credit.
After five phone calls spanning several hours I finally got on to someone who ""thought"" they could do it by taking my booking over the phone...but in the meantime the price had gone up by $700. After another hour on hold while they ""considered"" giving me the first fare, they came back and said I'd have to pay the higher one.
At that point I gave up, booked a flight for close to the first fare quoted from Air Canada, and applied for a refund of the credit from Qantas. Another hour on the phone to do that. My sense is that the staff manning the phone lines at Qantas are undertrained and that the company has no interest in catering to customers who have even slightly complicated queries.
I fly between Canada and Australia often---usually on Cathay, Singapore Air or Air Canada. My few experiences with Qantas have been the worst by far---I recommend avoiding the wherever possible.",October 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

At the airport I was organised a hotel room at the Novatel and a dinner and breakfast voucher to use for dinner. I arrived at 8:30pm to Sydney the transfer took an hour to come and pick us up. When I was dropped at the hotel I was told room service had stopped so couldn't use the dinner voucher and my flight was leaving before breakfast started, so I had to order outside of the voucher for dinner and breakfast. I put in a request to get these refunded on July 11th, the customer care team came back mid August requesting my bank details, I responded straight away, haven't heard from them since have followed up numerous times, and received no refund. I have tried emailing, calling with my reference number no responds and i have been hung up on, there is no live chat or any other way to contact them. Absolutely shocking.

1,Mr,"All problem previously expected and still happened.
Bought international flight brisbane - Sydney - Santiago - Rio, 3 months before my departure date. I was sure that i would have problem taking 2 bags, specially brisbane - sydney.
To avoid that i was making sure i buy the tickets from qantas website, not from other tird part websites, and on the process i was making sure that i had 2 luggages included or if i had to buy it, that wouldn't be a problem, cause i definitely was taking 2. No evidence about it was showing anywhere, first think weird.
Between i buy the ticket and actually flight, i asume that qantas changed the 2 bags that you are aloud to take to only 1 bag, so I end up at the airport with 2 luggages paying 300$ for the extra bag.
Also was asked for vaccination certificate, but is not everybody that is asked for it. But i had it, so that was not a problem.

It was a packed plane, but virtually no service and even a cup of terrible tea or coffee was US $5.00! Outrageous, and the staff looked so bored and obviously found the passengers to be an imposition!

Not much use for Tasmania. Upon calling them and with a wait of course, I have managed to get onto another flight but once again with a downgrade. Not of course that Qantas by default offer a refund for the downgrade. I should also say that I have platinum one status - the highest.

1,A slippery slope.....,"In the good old days, when you boarded a QF flight, cheerful staff would brighten your day with a good sense of Australian hospitality. Well those are just memories now. With the exception of the CSM, Brooke and the Japanese flight attendant, none of them smiled, helpful or friendly. There was not even an acknowledgement when boarding the plane. It really reminded me of my days catching the bus to school. And to think that one has to pay $22K for this non-service and unfriendly service. And since I am at it, QANTAS, your food to the US and back home sucks. Not to serve an entry is cheap skating and the portions would be appropriate for a 10 year old child....

I have flown with the airline now for coming up to 29 years and this is just a bloody shamble. And Alan Joyce, please go and retire so QANTAS can have some hope of being rescued.",September 2022,4,4,4,1,1,3,1,2

Unfortunately Qantas lived up to its reputation as the GBC (a name myself and friends refer to QF). Arrived in Sydney off an international flight with SQ (amazing as they always are) at 10:30am, retrieved bags and joined the QF domestic transfer queue by 11am for our 2pm domestic departure, all the time in the world you would have thought. It took until 1pm until we made it to the domestic terminal. Transfers area was full of people who missed connections because the staff took so long to check them in and they just didnt seem to care, not caring seems to be QF policy. Once we got on the transfer bus the driver didnt want to leave until the bus was full so we sat there for ages waiting, meanwhile pax were asking when are we going as they were running out of time to connect.

1,TERRIBLE ! TERRIBLE ! TERRIBLE !,"Where to start... I was travelling with a baby and let me tell you I do NOT recommend. When arriving at Sydney Airport the lady at check in was so rude. She refused to take my authorized luggage cause she decided I had enough already. When travelling with a baby I am allowed my luggage, a 10kg baby luggage and 3 baby items. I had only 2 baby items but she still refused me the 10kg one cause she wasn't feeling like it. Lucky I was travelling with my sister and her baby too and the lady that checked her in let her take my luggage. Then on board.... well again had to deal with staff abusing me. When I booked my flight I paid an extra $40 to have a bassinet. I was allocated the seat but once i arrived on board the staff asked me to change my seat with a guy. At first I refused and said I paid for my seat I shouldn't be the one moving. Then the staff starting to threaten me saying they spoke to the captain and the flight will return to Perth and they will take further action if I don't move. I let you imagine my state of mind with a newborn baby in my arms and having to deal with that. Staff were so unhelpful and rude and didn't care. I finally moved cause i had no choice but said I want to be refunded for the extra cost I paid, which they say 'yes of course contact the company they will refund you'. I flew in June and I am still waiting to get a refunded. When calling the customer center they either hang up on me or they are saying that seats can be changed on the day there is nothing they can do.... DO NOT FLY WITH QANTAS they are plenty more airlines that are so much better.",June 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
5,Melbourne to Brisbane,"Travelled on Saturday 3rd September. Flight was due to depart 3.20pm. Self-check in was easy and quick. Boarding and departure was the same. Flight arrival was delayed by 10 minutes and then another slight delay in getting my bag in Brisbane. Otherwise, a good flight.",September 2022,4,5,-1,5,5,4,5,5
1,Qantas Lost Baggar Service Terrible,"Qantas had lost our baggage from Karratha flight to Perth. This item was in oversize along with 2 other items, so not sure how they manage to not load 2 out of 3 items.

Upon arriving to Perth I went to lost baggage service and they had confirmed they had left the item back in Karratha. They put it on the next flight and will contact us when it arrives and will deliver to the address where we are staying.

My Wife recieved a call that evening but had missed the call and they left a message the item arrived and can be delivered but there was no number left to call back on.

Following day I called Qantas 1300 number and it went to a call centre Overseas. Explained to them what happened and gave them the lost property reference number only to be told they are still looking for the lost baggage and will call and arrange delivery when found.

I told the service guy that it's not correct that it's still lost and has arrived at Perth airport ready to be delivered.

I had to tell the person twice and each time was put on hold for 30mins while he tried make contact with Qantas Lost baggage counter at Perth Airport.

I asked if the item can be delivered by 10am that day or if not where can I pick the item up.

After nearly on hold for 1hour and 30mins I gave up.

Later that day I was near the Perth airport and dropped into the lost baggage service counter and there was 2 attendees and one customer.

We had never received a call all day to return our lost baggage and when asked why we can't call the lost baggae counter direct they said they take the phones off when busy.

Luckily the item was there but we weren't happy with the crap service that Qantas Lost Baggage had provided.

Issue could have been resolved if we could call direct or if Qantas followed through with calling back on how to pickup or have the item delivered.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Qantas,"The first leg of a trip to Singapore, what we had heard we were apprehensive about flying Qantas but how wrong we were. The flight left on time and arrived in Sydney with plenty of time to go across to the international terminal to catch our flight to Singapore, and the BIG worry was our baggage but after arriving our luggage was there waiting for us.
Qantas no worries highly recommended.",September 2022,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5
2,Unreliable,"We were at our gate and could see we were waiting for the Launceston flight that turned out 4 hrs late. We were only an hour late, but there was absolutely no communication. It seemed there was a shortage of gate agents as I overheard a ground worker on the phone. Boarding was a mess and rushed. This was an old plane with the engines near the tail and very noisy. The pilot said the delay was due to “significant maintenance “ it needed. Worrisome words. On board we had a soft drink, cheese and crackers. Not worth paying the more expensive prices Qantas charges. Maybe if they put passengers first, they would have greater profits as more would choose them, but I think Rex might be the best option.",September 2022,2,2,3,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
5,Great service,"Service was excellent. Staff very professional and helpful. They were able to accommodate seating requirements at short notice. Very knowledgeable about their products, friendly and seemingly happy even at 6am",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,Jim & Mary try to fly,"I tried to purchase 2 tickets to fly business class London to Sydney. The web site was not the easiest to navigate and when I tried to pay using a visa debit card. I got message "" we cannot process the card"" so I tried my Mastercard and same response. I rang Quantas customer service and got connected but couldnt understand what he was saying. I hung up and tried again. This time I could understand but the person was absolutely useless. I suggested I would try another airline. The person said ""fine"". I hung up and went onto The BA website where I got 2 tickets which were over £2500 cheaper than Quntas and my Visa card was accepted without a hitch.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,"Absolutely awful ""service""","Happened to be on the Qantas app and noticed 48 hrs before flying that a leg had been cancelled . No one informed me . When I called Qantas to work out a plan I basically am left hanging on hold until I hang up - have been trying for hours .
Ive been a member with Qantas for nearly 30 years . Their treatment / attitude is just awful.
Don't even consider using them - this Qantas is nothing like the Qantas we all once knew.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1
1,INCONVENIENCE AND STRESSFUL,"If you’re looking for a stress-free and hassle-free, NEVER EVER GO WITH QANTAS!!!
ALWAYS delayed flights and staffs are unhelpful.
Customer service as well are hard to reach.

Refunds and travel credits are scams!

They used to be one of the great airlines but THE WORST AIRLINE NOW!!!",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
1,business class booking not guaranteed,"We booked 2 seats on business class when they were first issued. We went on line 6/12 ahead to book our seat numbers. When we tried to check in on line 24 hours before we were told we could not check in on line. When we arrived at the airport we were issued with one business class seat and one economy class seat, with no apology or explanation.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1
1,"Lost bags, then ignored and unacknowledged. Never leave reviews but never experienced this shocking service before","Lost bag (incl work) x3 days on a direct flight, ignored my request for any sort of flight credit/compensation.

Useless communication about when bags would arrive, had work info in them and left anxious and unknown for days. then ignored when asked for compensation/flight credit for the clothes i had to buy",September 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1,Pathetic customer service. Impossible to get hold of lost baggage claims department.,The flight was fine. But don’t expect any customer service when things go wrong. Impossible to get hold of anyone unless the press get involved. And when they do they respond for a brief period and then you get automated messages saying your case is resolved when it isn’t. I will NEVER fly with them again.,July 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
4,Pleasantly suprised by domestic flight,I was mildly apprehensive but was pleasantly suprised to find social distancing on the aircraft. Every second seat was occupied Things seemed relaxed and their were no delays and depature from the aircraft was swift. Nothing seems to have changed about qantas.,September 2022,5,5,3,4,5,5,5,4
5,Qantas QF64 again performs across the Indian Ocean,"Flew ex JHB on 19 September 2022 in seat 20J (Premium Economy) and not only was the seat excellent, so was the service and the on time landing at Sydney. Cabin crew went out of their way to make the trip memorable. Could not fault the cleanliness of the cabin, food was very good and the little things contributed. Well done to the crew on this flight.",September 2022,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
5,Indian Ocean Crossing Number 20,"After a 2 year absence (covid enforced) flew in a Dreamliner (do miss the old 747) and have to say the service was excellent, and the seats (in Premium Economy) was quite comfortable and legroom satisfactory (I'm 188cm tall). Contrary to opinions expressed in Seat Guru with regard to PE found the change from old 747 economy an improvement.",August 2022,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
2,Still a long way to go and very expensive,"This was the return leg of my 6 week business trip to the USA and prior to Covid i would be commuting to the USA 4+ times a year on Qantas via Dallas. The trip over is a separate review and the worse behaviour by an airline i have ever experienced.
Qantas are currently flying the B787 Dreamliner on Syd/Dallas/Syd as they haven't got all their A380's back yet. The ticket prices were unbelievably expensive being the most expensive by 50% that i've ever paid and nearly double using Delta earlier in the year. In fact it was close to business class on AA a few years ago. The plane appeared to be mainly business people which is understandable given the ticket cost. It was i think probably 95% full. Shock #1 came when i checked in at Cincinnati when i was charged for an additional bag. I had noticed previously on the ticket it said 1 bag but the Qantas web site clearly said 3 bags for flights USA to Australia for Qantas Club. American Airlines check in rang Qantas to no avail with the guy saying they are having lots of issues with the Qantas baggage limits. Now i suspect this is because they have the B787 but it's dishonest to say 3 bags on the web site. Flight boarding was quite efficient at Dallas , the plane seemed quite clean and tidy. Meal time came along , 3 choices - Chicken Caesar salad, Beef Stew and a plant based dish. By the time they got to my seat all the Chicken had gone, i could hear others like myself grab the stew which they were fast running out of. I pity the folks that only had a choice of the plant based dish, doubt Qantas will do anything about it but lift your game on the meal choices in economy. Entertainment on board good choices. I am not sure how comfortable the seat cushion actually is. Was very happy to see my bags in Sydney.
Am seriously considering other options for my next business trip to the USA which is sad because i tried to fly Australian to keep Australians in jobs. It may be a first world problem to complain about the meals and the baggage charges but when i hear Allan Joyce saying how things are improving it grates me.",September 2022,3,-1,5,3,2,5,4,2
1,Qantas airways are ridiculously unprofessional,"Flight delayed 3 hours due to wheel change, missed my connection.
Guy at destination writes 2 flight numbers at the back of the ticket and hurries me along.
One day later i come to airport to find that im not flying anywhere, go to qantas stand - its empty. Call them by the number, they say i flew the day before to Ho chi ming.
So i check the flights the guy gave me, and they are to Saraevo instead of Riga. I ask the employee on the phone what do i do now. She says something along the lines of boo hoo, better luck next time.
This is not ok.",September 2022,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
